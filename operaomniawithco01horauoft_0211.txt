7. 87 ⁴ spem mentitaseges: and contrast
Od. 3. 16. 30 ‘ segetis certa fides’), and
the fruit-trees are represented as always
able (⁶ nunc,' ‘ nunc,' ‘nunc') to excuse
themlselves and throw the blame on the
weat er.

3²· sidera, the heat attributed to the
Dogstar. Epod. 16. 61 ‘ nullius astri
Gregem aestuosa torret impotentia.’

· 33. eontractapisoe-‚ etc. Variously
taken of the ‘ iscinae marinae' in which
the fish find t emselves inclosed, and of

cept that here it is the sense of weari-
ness, there of greed, that is prominent.

37. Minae, the forebodings of his
own imagination.

’ 38. scandunt, they can clamber into
the villa built out in the water, by the
same entrance as the master.

neque decedit, etc„ the marine villa
is lost in the general idea of the impos-
sibility of flying from care. With the
whole stanza cp. 2. 16. 21 foll. and see
note there. The reminiscence of Lu-
cretius (2. 47 foll.) is more evident in
this place than in that. ‘Timor et
Minae' recalls ‘metus hominum, curae-
que sequaces,’ and in the following
stanza we may hear the echo of ‘ neque
fulgorem reverentur ab auro, Nec cla·
rum vestis splendorem purpureai.'

41. quodsi, etc. The application of
the moral professedly to himself, really
to those whose desires are not as mode—
rate.

Phrygius lapis, a famous marble,
white with red spots, brought from
gznnada in Phrygia. Cp. esp. Stat.
