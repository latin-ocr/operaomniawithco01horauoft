HORATII EPODON LIBER.

*-

EPODE I.

‘Y0u‚ Maecenas, are going to expose yourself to all the dangers of war sor
Caesar’s sake—what think you Ι shall do, to whom you are as much as Caesar
can be to you? I shall follow you to the world's end. Do you ask what good
Ι can do ? I shall be in less terror if I am with you than if Ι am absent. Ι have
no'selfish motive'. Your bou-nty has made me rich enough already. I don't want
more either to hoard or to squander.’

, This Epode is usually referred (after the Scholiast) to the spring of B.c. 31, when
AugustuS‚ according to Dio (50. 1 1), before setting out to Actium, summoned the
'chief men of Rom ‚ senators and equites, to meet him at Brundisium : τοὺς μὲν ὅπως
τι συμπράξουσιν αὐτ’“ τοὺς δ’ ὅπως μηδὲν μοῦωθέντεε νεοχμῶσωσι, τό τε μέγιστον ὅπως
ἧνδείξηται τοῖς ἀνθρᾷῦποιε ὅτι καὶ τὸ·πλεΐστον καὶ τὸ κράτιστον τῶν Ῥωμαίων ὁμογνω-
² μονοῦν ἔχοι. It‚wou1d be probable that Maecenas would go with the rest, although
he mustflhave returned to Rome and not gone on to Actium, as Dio (51. 3) speaks
os hishaving been lest in charge of Rome and Italy during the campaign.
Mr. Dyer, however (in the Classical Museum, vol. ii. p. 20 soll.‚ and in the D ct.
Biog. s. v. Maecenas), argues strongly for the view that the Epode belongs to the
war against Sextus Pompeius in the year 13.c. 36, when there is reason (Appiam de
Bell. Civ. 5. p. 729) to believe that Maecenas was in Sicily with Octavianus. He
thinks that Horace actually accompanied him as he proposes to do, and that the
otherwise unidentified escape from shipwreck m the poet' s life (⁶ Sicula Palinurus
unda,’ Od. 3. 4. 28 q. v.) belongs to tfiis expedition.

IBIS Liburnis inter alta navium,

Paratus omne Caesaris periculum
Subire, Maecenas, tuo.

1. Liburnis, Od. 1. 37. 30, ships of
a light bussd, modelled on the piratical
vessels of the Liburni, a tribe on the
Illyn'an coast. They were the strength
of Octavianus’ fleet at Aetium. Those
who maintain the Sicilian reference of
the Epode quote Appizm, l..c, where
Liburnian galleys are named among the
ships of Octavianus which were lost
in a storm during a campaign against

Sextus Pompeius.

2. alta propugnacula.1f the scene
is Actium, these are the wooden towers
(Plut. Ant. 66) on Antony' s ships.
