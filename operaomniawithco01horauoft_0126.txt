,84 HORATII CARMINUM

Percurrisse polum morituro. ⁴
Occidit et Pelopis genitor, conviva deorum,
Tithonusque remotus in auras,

Et Iovis arcanis Minos admissus, habentque
Tartara Panthoiden iterum Orco

Demissum, quamvis, clipeo Troiana refixo
Tempora testatus, nihil ultra

Nervos atque cutem morti concesserat atrae,
Iudice te non sordidus auctor

Naturae verique. Sed omnes una manet nox 15

morituro, the oese ruled by ‘ tibi’
(Madv. ξ 393 c), the time fixed by
‘ tentasse’ and ‘ percurrisse? ‘ What pro-
fits it you now to have scaled the homes
of the sky, and in spirit to have ranged
from star to star through the round
heaven, you that had still to die Γ Cp.
2. 3. 4, where ‘moriture’ occupies the
same emphatic position.

7 foll. The instances are of those
who seemed at one time to have
escaped the universal law: Tantalus,
when he feasted with the gods; Tithonus,
when he was beloved by Aurora, and
snatched by her into the sky (Eur. Tro.
855 ὃν ἀστέρων τέθριππος ἔλαβε χρύσεοε
ὄχος ἀναρπάσας); Minos, when Jove
himself counselled him in the art of
lawgiving (cp. Hom. Od. 19. 179 Διὸς
μεγάλου ὄαριστής); Pythagoras, when
he proved that he had outlived one
.death. The form of argument is that
of Hom. Il. 18. 117, so often imitated,
οὐδὲ γὰρ οὐδὲ βίη Ἡρακλῆος φύγε κῆρα 1
ὅσπερ φίλτατος ἔσκε Διῒ Κρονίωνι ἄνακτι

Ι . . ὡς καὶ ἐγών, usmi- Horace uses the
myths of Tantalus and Tithonus (‘ longa
Tithonum minuit senectus? Od. 2. 16.
30) for other purposes elsewhere; here
we are not to think of the punishment of
the one or the old age of the other, only
os the fact that, though plivileged above
humanity‚ they died at last like others.

ι ιο. ⁶ And the son of Panthus is in
¹ Tartarus now since he descended a
second time to the lower world, for all
¹· that before (for he took down his shield
and proved his knowledge of the days

of Troy) he had yielded to black death
no spoils beyond mere sinews and skin.'
Pythagoras was -said to have supported
his doctrine of μετεμψύχωσιε by assert-

ing that his own soul had animated the ’ ,

body of Euphorbus (Πάνθου υἱὸν ἐϋμμε-
λίην, whom Menelaus slew, Hom. 11. ’
17. 69), a fact which he proved by re-
cognizing Euphorbus' shield hung with
‘'tssfflssrssfffl' ἓέἒὴῖἐὲἶε of punish-
ment, but of the lower world generally,
as in Virg. G. 1. 36, where the Elysian
plains seem to be included in it. No
distinction is intended between ‘ Tar-
tara’ and ‘ Orco? ‘ Orco demittere’ is
a Virgilian phrase representing Homer's

Ἀῖδι προωπτειν. For the dat. see on -

Od. 1. 24. 18.

14. iudice te. As addres'sed to Ar-
chytas this is simple, and the mse of
Pythagoras is a natural climax. Those⁴
who put the words into Archytas’
mouth are driven either to alter, with
Jani‚ ‘te’ to ‘mess or to suppose that
Archytas presumes in all the world the
same reverence for his master that he
feels himself. ·

15. sed, advers. to the last clause.
He may have been a great philosopher,
but he was a man, and death knows no
exceptions.

Archytas’ answer begins here. The
