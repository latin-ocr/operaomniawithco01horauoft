Neve· te nostris vitiis iniciuum

Ocior aura

Tollat3 hic magnos potius triumphos,
Hic ames dici pater atque princeps, 50
Neu sinas Medos equitare inultos,

⁹ Te duce, Caesar.

⁷ Invidet, atque hominum queritur curare
triumphos; Quippe ubi fas versum at-
que nesas,’ etc.

47. nostris vitiis iniquum, ‘ in-
tolerant of‚' ‘ non diutius aequa mente
vitia ferentem.‘ F ranke sees in these
words a reference to the eenson‘an
power which Octavianus had accepted
in the year ac. ²9·

48. aura tollat, keeps up the cha-
racter of the winged Mercury, ever ‘ on
tiptoe ' for ssight.

49. triumpho& ‘ Caesar triplici in-
vectus Romana trium ho Moenia‚’ Virg.
Aen. 8. 714; ‘Cumles triumphos tres
egit, Dalmaticum, Actiacum, Alexandri-
ιὸιὲηιτ continuo triduo omnes‚' Suet.

t. 22.

50. pater. The title of ⁶ Pater pa-
triae’ was not solemnly given to Au-
gustus by the Senate till B.c. 2. but, as
Ovid says, Fast. 2. 127, it was only the
ratification os a title which had been
long given him by popular usage:
‘Sancte Pater patriae, tibi Plebs, tibi
Curia nomen Hoc dedit; hoc dedimus
nos tibi nomen Eques; Res tamen ante
dedit? It was a title familiar to Roman
ears, having been given by the Senate
to Cicero (Juv. 8. 243), and in earlier

times to Camillus by the army (Li‘v. 5.
{²32 ἱηέἓῗμῑῖἒῗῗξὲεὲἦξῗῖἱε ξὲἓριὲῗὲ
the column erected in the Forum to
Julius Caesar's memory, Suet. Jul. 85,
Cic. Phil. 1. 2. Horace promises (Od.
3. 24. 27) a similar title to any one who
will venture to restrain the lieence of
the time, pointing. of course, to Au-
gustus, ‘ Si quaeret Pater urbium Sub-
scribi statuis, indomitam audeat Re-
frenare licentiam.' The title of 'Princeps'
(Od. 4. 14. 6), sc. ‘ senatus: must also
(if we take Franke's date sor the Ode)
be here anticipated‚ as it was conferred
on him in the following year (8.0. 28) ¹
by Agrippa, his colleague in the Censor-
ship, Dio C. 53. 1.

51. Augustus is to restore the dis-
turbed order of things, vv. 21, 22, to
stay the civil war, and to retrieve the
military glory os Rome, which had been
tarnished by the defeat of Crassus in
Rc. 53. and Antony in nc. 36.

equitare, Od. 2. 9. 24.

5²· Caesar. The true name of the
incarnate Mercury is reserved to be the
last word left on our ears, the word that
stills all the sears and satisfies all the
doubts of the preceding stanzas.
