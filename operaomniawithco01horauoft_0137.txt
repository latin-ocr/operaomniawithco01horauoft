O D E XXXIII.

⁸ Tarm< not too much, Albius, of Glycera’s faithlessness‚ nor write piteous elegies
about your rejection. It is the way always. Lycoris pining for Cyrus: Cyrus in

” love with Pholoe, who will as soon wed him as a she goat a wolf. This is merely
’ Venus’ cruel sport. Ι am not exempt from the law?

The Ode is addressed to Albius Tibullus, the poet, to whom also Horace wrote
an‘Epistle (1. 4). Glycera is not one of the mistresses to whom any of Tibullus’
extant poems are addressed. See Dean Milman’s Article on Tibullus in the Dict.

1. ne doleas, ‘ to prevent your griev-

= ing, consider these facts? It is not a

direct prohibition, but the negative
purpose of the coming recital. Cp. 2. 1.
q 37 and 4. 9. 1.

- plus nimio, see on Od. 1. 18. 15. It
seems to qualify ⁶ doleas ’ as well as

. ⁸ memor.'

2. immitis Glycerae, with a play

¹ miserabiles, ‘piteous.’ ‘moving pity.'

’ ‘irascar amicis Cur me funesto pro-
v petent arcere veterno‚’ ‘be angry‚ ‘and
’- ask what they mean by wamingl me,’ etc.

So in prose, Cic. ad Att. 3. 9 ⁴ quod me
accusas, cur hunc meum casum tam
graviter feram, debes ignoscere!

5 foll, Cp. the sixth Idyll of Mo-
schus, '‘Hpa Πὰν Ἀχῶς τᾶς γείτονος ἤρατο
δ’ Ἀχῶ σκιρτητᾶ Σατύρου, Σάτυρος δ’
ἐπεμαίνετο Λύδᾳ, κ.τ.λ.

5. tenui fronte. Mart. 442. 9 ‘frons
brevis: Cp. Epp. 1. 7. 26 v‘reddes . .
nigros angusta fronte capillos.’ It is a
mark there of youth as well as of good
looks, and seems to suggest that this
admiration for a low forehead‚ or rather
for hair low down on the forehead‚ was
connected with the horror which a
Roman felt for baldness.

6. torret. The metaphoris Sappho's‚
ὅπταιε ἄμμε Fr. 115. ,
Cyrus . . Pholoen, see App. 1. The
name of ‘Cyrus' appears in Od. 1. 17.
25, that of ‘Pholoe fugax’ in Od. 2.
5. 17. In both mses the type of cha-
racter, if not the person indicated, is
the same as in this place. ‘Pholoe‘
is the name of a coy or coquettish girl

in Tibull. 1. 8.

in asperam declinat. ‘ Asperam ' is
not a mere epithet, but predicative.
Cyrus, instead of pursuing Lycoris, turns
aside aster Pholoe, but only to find her
bristles set against him.
