348 HORATn EPODON

EPO DE V11. ι

¹ Is civil war to be renewed, and Roman blood to flow again, not for the destruc-
tion of a foreign enemy, but to do the Parthian’s work and destroy Rome itsels?
Even wild beasts do not prey on their own kind. Does anger blind you, or fate
compel you, or is it mere wauton wickednoes? Shame makes them silent, Ι will
answer for them. It is the bitter heritage of fratricidal bloodshed which descends
to us from the death of Remus.¹

There is nothing to fix with precision the date of the Epode. It expresses horror
at the prospect os some fresh outburst of civil w'ar. It is of course possible, as the
Scholiasts say, that it may express the first feeling with which Horace witnessed
the renewal of the struggle after Caesar’s death, although he was very soon to be
involved in the war himself. More probably it refers to some later moment, the
commencement, it may be, as Orelli thinks, of the ‘war of Perusia’ in 41 ; but a
mere rumour of war is enough to account for such a poem. The idea of the con—
clusionis Greek not Roman. ΤΙιε explanation offered in it of the snccession of
civil strife is faneiful and literary, without the definite politica] meaning which
underlies the mythological form of such poems as Od. 1. 2. Compare in this respect, ¹
as in others, Epod. 16, which belongs to the same period.

5-8. ‘Not as our fathers shed their
blood sor foreign conquest, nor as we

sults to have been estimated, and there
was no political reason for exaggerating

might shed ours to complete their con-
quests.’

7. intaetus= ‘integer‚’ Od. 4. 4. 66.
‘non ante devictus? Macleane thinks
that both couplets refer to exploits
already aceomplished‚ ⁴ to achieve such
victories as Scipio or Julius Caesar.'
But the conquest of Britain is to Horace
even in the Odes a triumph still in the
future. If we assign even the earliest
date to the Epode, Caesar's invasion
was long enough past forits small re-

them.

demandaret, to be explained in eon-
nection with the expresswn ‘sacer cli-
vus’ in od. 4. 2. 35, see note there.
The triumphal procaesion desoended by
the ‘Sacra via’ into the F orum,
which it to the foot of the Capi-

toline hill. Before the ascent of that ⁶

began the captives were led aside from
the ranks. Cp. Cic. Verr. 5. 30 ‘ Cum >
