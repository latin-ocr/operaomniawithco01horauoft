At expedita Sagana per totam domum 25
Spargens Avernales aquas
Horret capillis ut marinus asperis
Echinus aut currens aper.
Abacta nulla Veia conscientia
Ligonibus duris humum 30
Exhauriebat ingemens laboribus,
Quo posset infossus puer-
Longo die bis terque mutatae dapis

Inemori spectaculo,

Cum promineret ore, quantum exstant aqua 35
Suspensa mento corpora 3.

Exsecta uti medulla et aridum iecur
Amoris esset poculum,

Interminato cum semel fixae cibo
Intabuissent populae. 40

the teeth of a wild beast? In any case
they are appropriate to this ‘desideri
poculum, ’ as typical of the rage of dis·

⁷ appointed animal passion. Compare m

this respect the more potent spell of vv.
37-40· ¹

24. Colchicis = ‘magicisss such as
Medea might have kindled.

25. expedita= succincta: Sat. 1. 8.
²3-

26. Avernales, as the witch 1n Virg.
Aen. 4. 512 Sparserat et latices simula-
tos fontis Averni.'

28.eur1·ens. The epithet seemed
out of place to Bentley, as the boar's
bristles do not rise more when he is run-
ning, and he advocates Heinsius’ conjec-
ture ‘ Laurens? But ‘ currens ’ is in
point as completing the whole resem-
blance of the boar to Sagana bustling
” about. It has the more place, as we
have had no definite verb to express her
movements.

²9· abacta nulla conscientia, ‘not
one whit deterred b'y her consciousness
of what she was doing,’ i. e. of its cruelty
and wickedness. For the use of ‘nulla’
see on Od. 3. 20. 7.

30. duris, not quite an inert epithet,
if we compare Od. 3. 11. 31, 4. 4. 57.
The ‘hardness ’ of the iron is in a way
identified with the persistence of her
purpose—she would dig till the iron was
tired.

humum, the soil in the ‘impluvium ’

of the house (v. 2 5) in which the scene
is laid.

33. bis terque. So all the good
MSS. and editors since Bentley, against
the v. 1. ‘bis terve? He points out that
the two readings differ materially in
sense. ⁴ Bis terque' =‘ saepe,’ cp. A. P.
440 ‘ melius te posse negares, Bis terque
expertum frustra’; ‘bis terve'=‘raro‚'
ep. A. P. 358.

34. inemori spectaculo, ἐναποθνή-
σκειν τῇ θέᾳ. ‘ Inemori ’ is an ἅπαξ. λεγ.

36. suspenso mento explains ‘ quan-
tum exstant aqua‚’ ‘as much as is above
water of a swimmer's body, when it
floats as though it hung by the chin.’

37. exsecta. This (or “execta') is
the reading of V and Β, and of the MSS.
of Aer. and Porph. Bentley’s objection
that we require rather an epithet to
correspond with ‘aridum‚' is very well
answered by Ritter. We do not require
one, for ‘aridum ’ is intended to cover
both substantives‚ as is ‘exsecta' also;
see on Od. 2. 10. 6, 2. 11. 1, 2. 15. 18.
20„3. 4. 18, 4. 9. 29. The other MSS.
offer many variants. ‘Jexsucta ‘’exsucca‚

‘‚exuta’ ſtrexerta ’ Bentley preferred a
conjecture of Heinsiusst exesa.'

39. interminato, pass. part. of the
usually deponent‘ interminor‚’ a stronger
word than ‘interdico‚' ‘forbidden with
threats?

semel with‘ cum,' ‘as soon as ever.’
as ‘ut semel,’ Sat. 2. 1. 24.
