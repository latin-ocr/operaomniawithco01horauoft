by Ritter for his edition, and by Usener for Keller and Holder. It is
assigned by Ritter and by Usener to the 9th century. It forms part
of a quarto volume, which contains also Servius' Commentary on
Virgil, two Treatises on Rhetoric‚ Bede’s History, and Ovid’s Meta-
morphoses. It is imperfect, omitting all the Epistles and the Satires, ἱ
with the exception of the first two and part of the third of Book 1,
besides large portions of the Odes. The Odes are not arranged
in their usual order, the copyist having apparently started with the
intention of an arrangement according to metres‚ for he begins with
nineteen Sapphic Odes. These follow the common order, though
the distinction of Books is not marked. They are succeeded by some
of the Epodes, then by the Carm. Sec„ then by the remaining Odes
and Epodes, also in their usual order. The Ars Poet. 1-440 follows
the Epodes, then Sat. 1. 1, 2 and part of 3. The omissions in the
Odes and Epodes are as follows z—of whole Odes in Book Ι, Odes
3-7, 9, 11, 33 and 34; in Book III, Ode 3; and of Book IV, Odes 3
and' 15, besides parts of twenty-one more Odes and Epodes, viz. Odes

3. Of the roth century the following MSS. have been collated for
Keller’s edition :-

A. Paris, 7900 ⁸. This has been held by Otto Jahn and others to
belong to the century before. With it Holder closely connects
(a) a MS. known as a, formerly belonging to Avignon, now in the
Ambrosian Library at Milan (No. 136), which he has collated
for the Satires and Epistles. I had the opportunity of inspect-
ing it for a few hours, and have taken account of its readings
in some of the more disputed passages in the Odes.
