LIB. III.

OD. 20. 225

Spissa te nitidum comas ²5
Puro te similem, Telephe, Vespero,
Tempestiva petit Rhode:
Me lentus Glycerae torret amor meae.

meant is the Rhode of the next lines,
‘She doesn’t care for Lycus, but she
will soon be here to look for Tele-
phus.’

24-26. Dillr. remarks how the repeti-
tion of ‘Lycus' and of ‘te' serves the
purpose of emphasizing them, the one

by way of scorn, the other of compli-
ment.
26. puro, as ‘sole puro,' 3. 29. 45,
shining in a clear sky. Cp. 3. 9. 21
⁴ sidere pulchrior.’ ·
27. tempestiva, suited in point of age.
28. lentus; 1. 13. 8.·

NON vides, quanto moveas periclo,
Pyrrhe, Gaetulae catulos leaenae?
Dura post paullo fugies inaudax
Proelia raptor,
Cum per obstantes iuvenum catervas 5
Ibit insignem repetens Nearchum,
Grande certamen, tibi praeda cedat

Maior an illi.

2. Gaetulum see on 1. 23· 10.

3. post paullo = ⁸ paullo post' even in
prose. Dillr. points out the antithetical
arrangement os the words ‘ dura . . inau-
dax‚’ ‘inaudax raptor’ z the last has the
force osan oxymoron, ‘ Inaudax ’ is an
invention of Horace from the Gr. ἄτολ-

οε.
μ 6. insignem, easily found among
them all.

7. grande certamen. We need not
understand ‘est’ or ‘erit’; it is rather
a cognate accusative characterising the
action of the -last sentence by giving its

“ result, a construction common enough

in Greek. Dillr. collects some other
instance's of it in Latin: Sat. 1. 4. 110,
Epp. 1. 18. 49, Virg. Aen. 6. 2²3 (where
see Conington’s note), 8. 683.

praeda . . maior, not ‘who -should
win more of the prey‚’ for the prey was
one; but ‘who should rather win the
prey.’ Cp. Epod. 5. 29. It is a not
uncommon confusion of 1anguage; see
Madv. 5 300 c, with foot note. We
may compare the use of ‘multus' for
‘multum’ (Sat. 1. 7. 28 ‘multo
fluenti ’)‚ and such expressions as Virg.
Aen. 1. 181 ⁸ Anthea si quem lactatum
pelago videat’=‘if he could see any·
