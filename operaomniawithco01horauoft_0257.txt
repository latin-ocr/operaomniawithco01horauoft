ness of the desires and ways of youth keptv on when youth itself has departed.
The spirit is rather that of the Epodes (⁶ Archilochio felle,’ Mitsch.) than of the
Odes· ‚possibly a real person may be pointed at. Meineke suggested that the name

N othus a name unknown to exstant Greek literature, was the poetical represen-
tative of the common Latin‘ Spurius? see Introd to 2. 4.

Chloris 1s wamed that she is at once old and poor.

“It is time to give up her

wauton ways. What suits her daughter Pholoe does not suit her. She is the wife
of a poor man. Let- her take her wool and spin. That w-ill be more beeoming to

her than the harp and the wine-cup.’

UXOR pauperis Iby'ci, ,
Tandem nequitiae fige modum tuae
Famosisque laboribus:
”Maturo propior desine funeri
³ Inter ludere virgines 5
Et stellis nebulam spargere candidis.
Non, si quid Pholoen satis,
Et te, Chlori, decet: filia rectius
Expugnat iuvenum domos,
Pulso Thyias uti concita tympano. 10
Illam 'cogit amor Nothi
Lascivae similem ludere capreae:
¹Te lanae prope nobilem
Tonsae Luceriam, non citharae decent
Nec flos purpureus rosae 15
Nec poti vetulam faece tenus cadi. ζ

3. famosis laboribus, infamous as
compared with‘ lanificium.¹

4. maturo, ripe, for which you are
ready

6. yTo spoil the look of their com-
pany as a cloud does a starry sky.

9. expugnat domos. The editors
quote Sen. Nat. Q. 4, praef. ‘Crispus
Passienus saepe dicebat, adulationi ‘nos
3531⁰}?{⁶'3513¹12?1¹30¹Li¹ffi1 ⁰333} {5113ss
solet, qugd, si impulit, grata est, gratior,
si effregit?

14. Luceriam, an important town
in the interior of Apulia. It, is called
‘nobilem,’ as famous for its wool, Plin.

H. N. 8. 48. She is to think now only

of getting the best wool. The editors
compare an anonymous epigram, Brunck,
An. 3, p. 116 ‘H τὸ πριν αὐχήσασα πολυ-
χρύσοιε ἐπ’ ἔρασταΐε, H Νέμεσιν δεινὴν
οὐχὶ κύσασα θεάν, Μίσθια νῦν σπαθίοιε
πενιχροΐε πηνίσματα κρούει* ’0ψέ γ’ Ἀθη-
ναίη Κύπριν ἐληΐσατο.

16. vetulam. The better MSS. are
in favour of ⁶ vetula’; the Comm. Cruq.
and one half of Porph.'s scholium in

favour of ‘vetulam‚' ‘ non decet aetatem

tuam in convivio multum potare-³ Ve-
tula would be easily altered by omitting
the mark of the m, and the distance of
‘ te’ would tempt a copyist to assimi-
late the adjective to the nearer sub-
stantive ⁸ faece.¹
