HORATII CARMINUM

N

Adduxere sitim tempora, Virgili3
Sed pressum Calibus ducere Liberum
Si gestis, iuvenum nobilium cliens, 15
< Nardo vina merebere.
Nardi parvus onyx eliciet cadum,
' Qui nunc Sulpiciis accubat horreis,
Spesx donare novas largus amaraque
Curarum eluer‘e efficax, 20
Ad quae si properas gaudia, cum tua
Velox merce veni: non ego te meis
Immunem meditor tingere poculis,
Plena dives ut in domo.
Verum pone moras et studium lucri, ²5
Nigrorumque mernor, dum licet, ignium
Misce stultitiam consiliis brevem:
Dulce est desipere in loco.

17. nardi parvus onyx. ‘Onyx‘ is
properly a kind os marble or alabaster,
so named from its resemblance in colour
to the human nail; then a cup or box,
first, of this material; lastly, it would
seem, of any material. See Prop. 4. 10.
22 ‘murreus onyx’3 ⁵ unguenta optime
servanturin alabastris: Plin. N. H. 13. 3;
cp. the ἀλάβαστρον μῦρου νάρδου πιστι-
κῆς of St. Mark 14. 3. Dillr„ who ex-
plains ‘studium lucri' in v. 25, of the
bargain between the wine aud the nard,
quotes the story in the Gospels, as
showing the costliness' of the nard (⁸ 300
denarii '=between ⁵69 and 4610), for
whigh he also refers to Pliny 12. 26, 13.
2, 1 . 59.

18. Sulpiciis horreis. ⁶ Horrea '
were ‘store-houses ' of any kind; see ou
3. 28. 7. Here the reference is either
to vaults where wine was to be bought,
or, less likely, to the store-houses in
which, in later times, we hear of persons
keeping their property of various kinds
for which they had not room at home.
The name ⁴ Sulpiciis' would refer to
the original erector of the buildings, or
possibly, as Orelli thinks, to the pos-

sessor, the produce of whose farm and ‚
vineyard was disposed of in this way.
Orelli quotes an inscription which makes
mention of some ‘horrea Galbana,'
which would probably be the same as
the ‘Sulpicia‚' since ‘Galba' was a
cognomen of the gens Sulpicia; and
Porph. asserts that the name ‘Galbae
horrea ’ belonged in his time to a
certain store of wine and oil, etc. The
form ‘Sulpiciis' is, as Orelli ints
out, regular. Cp. ‘ Corneliae, uliae.
leges· ; ‘ Licinia atria: Cic. pro· Quinct.
