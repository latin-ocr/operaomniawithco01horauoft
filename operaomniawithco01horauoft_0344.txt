ODE XII.

¹ ermz-is past, and Spring reigns again. The ice is gone, the swallow builds,
shepherds sing their songs in the open air. Come, theu, Virgilius, and inaugurate
the thirsty season with a easlt of the best wine I mn get you. But you shall not

come empty handed3 you bring the ointment if I find the wine. Above all, come '

with a mind void os care, and prepared for free enjoyment.’

The chief interest of the Ode centres in the question to whom it was addressed.
It is a playsul letter actually sent by Horace on some occasion to the great poet,
and published six years after his death, not so much for its intrinsic merits as for
its reminiscences of their friendship? On this theory (and it is held by Din‘. and
was held by Bentley), we may expect there to be allusions in it which are now un·
intelligible, though they would probably be well understood by Maecenas and the
many survivors of the literary circle in which virgil and Horace met. Doring·
who also takes this view, points out that the images of the first three stamas have
a special appropriateness as addressed to a poet, and the poet of the BuooIIcs and
Georgics. The chief difficulties in the way of the theory. apart from the absence
of any tradition on the subject (sor the Scholiasts all imagine some other Virgilius
to be intended), lie in expressions of v. 15 ‘iuvenum nobilium cliens: and v. 25
⁸ studium lucri! Of course these can be disposed of as novering meanings to which
we have lost the key; but it is rather hard to imagine any possible meaning&

‘Pone moras et studium lucri,¹ is exactly the style in which Horace would address
one of his ordinary friends engaged' m the common pursuits of the day; but what
mn it mean addressed to virgil? We <annot really refer it to the propendat

exchange of wine for nard, and take it to mean, ‘’Don t haggle about the bugam-“³⁹
⁵ ‘Iuvenum nobilium cliens? again, is natural enough and complimentaryenongh.
when some special‘ iuvenes nobiles? as Drusus and Tibenus, are in Horaoe· spoct-
ical favour, when the fact of the dependency is notorious, and the point is the
nobility‚ in the best sense, of the patrons; but at what period of Virgil's life could
it have sounded like a compliment? Macleane is content with the Scholiast’s sug*-
gestion that Augustus and Maecenas are the ⁸ iuvenes'3 but he mn somoely have
really thought that the possibility of such an expression was proved by Homee’s
calling Augustus ⁴ iuvenis· in 1. 2. 41. There is, perhaps, a small indication that
