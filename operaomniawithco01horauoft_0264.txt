Si tener pleno cadit haedus anno, ,ιςγ ’
Larga nec desunt Veneris sodali
Vina craterae, vetus ara multo>
Fumat odore.
Ludit herboso pecus omne campo,
Cum tibi Nonae redeunt ‚Decembres3 10
Festus in. pratis.. vacat otioso
Cum bove pagus3-
Inter audaces lupus errat agnos;
Spargit agrestes tibi silva* frondes;
Gaudet invisam pepulisse fossor 15
Ter pede terram.

5. pleno anno, when the year is
nearly full, in December; or, perhaps,
only like· per exactos annos: 3. 22. 6=
quotannis‚’ at intervals of a full year.

6. Veneris sodali craterae, ‘the
bowl, Venus' mate? Orelli quotes an
address to a flagon, Βάκχου καὶ Μουσέων
ἱλαρὴ λάτρι καὶ Κυθερείης. Perhaps it is
thus characterized as fitting the title
given to Faunus ιιι v. 1. Ritter makes

‘craterae’ the genitive with‘ vina,’ ‘wine
in the bowlss some particular bowl
known to be set for Faunus, and takes
‘ Veneris sodali ’ of the god himself.

7. vetus implius that these rites
have been duly performed during many
generations. Macleane puts a full
stop at ‘craterae‚’ and makes the gen·
lelral description of the Faunalia begin

ere.

12. pag-us. There is a curious va·
riant in some of the best MSS, ‘ pardus,⁹
the origin of which Bentley ingeniously

HORATII CARMINUM

traces to some monkish *eopyr 'st, who
had ιἰι mind the prophecy of Isaiah.
