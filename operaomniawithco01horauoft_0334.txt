HORATII CARMINUM

Hic saxo, liquidis ille coloribus

Sollers nunc hominem ponere,‚nunc deum.

Sed non haec mihi vis, nec tibi talium

Res est aut 'animus deliciarum egens. 10
Gaudes carminibus3 carmin-a possumus

Donare etv pretium dicere muneri.

Non incisa· notis -marmora' publicis,

Per quae spiritus et vita redit bonis

8. ponere, to ‘represent‚’ properly of Attempts have been made to exp

sculpture3 to set up, to leave standing
before you. Cp. A. P. 36 ‘Infelix operis
summae, quia ponere totum Nesciet,’
Od. 4. 1. 20 ‘ponet marmoream‚’ Virg.
E. 3. 46, and the correlative ‘starel Sat.
2. 3. 183 ‘aeneus ut stes? It is trans-
ferred to poetical representation Juv. 1.
1. 155 ‘ Pone Tigellinum.’

9. haec vis, ·either=‘ facultas? sc.
‘ donandi talia.’ but it is hard to parallel
the use, or: ‘harum deliciarum copia,'
as ‘hederae vis,’ 4. 11. 4.

nec is the reading of V against the
more common ‘n0n.'

10. res . . animus, you are too 'rich
y to want such dainty presents, too simple
in your tastes to care sor them.

12. pretium dicere muneri, i. e.
tell you how much it is worth. The
construction as in Sat. 2. 3. 23 ‘Callidus
huic signo ponebam milia centum,' Ter.
Hecyra Prol. 41 ‘ si nunquam avare
pretium statui arti meae.’ The re-
mainder of the Ode is occupied in set-
ting its value on the gist.’ i. e. in setting
forth the ‘deathless powers' that '‘to
verse belong-³

1 3. notis publicis, inscriptions graven'
by order of the State. There seems to
be an allusion to an act of Augustus
(Suet. Aug. 31), who haderected in his
Forum statues of the great generals of the
Republic‚ with laudatory inscriptions.

13-20. The general meaning of these
lines is clear, though the literature which
they have occasioned is a sufficient proof
that their expression is somewhat con-
fused. ‘ No other record of great deeds,
such as statues and inscriptions (which
may be destroyed and obliterated), not
the great deeds themselves (which may
be' forgotten)‚ can confer immortality of
same as poetry can.’ The expression
begins generally as is he were going to
talk of all great generals; the second
clause narrows it to Scipio Africanus
Major. The chief difficulty lies in v. 17.

lain
that verse of the buming of the camp of
Syphax by the elder Scipio, Liv. 30. 53
or the buming of the Carthaginian ships
surrendered at the end of the Second
Punic War, ‘quarum conspectum repente
incendium [tradunt] tam lugubre fuisse
Poenis quam si tum ipsa Carthago ar-
deret‚' Liv. 30. 433 and if Ennius himg
self had used such a phrase, we might
have explained it in one of these ways as ,
a natural exaggeration; but, after the
actual event. the ‘buming of Carthage'
in a Roman’s mouth can hardly mean' ¹
anything but its burning by Scipio Afri·

Punic War, in 1³.c. 146. seventeen years
after* the death of the elder Scipio. and
five years aster the death of his friend

the poet Ennius, who in his Annales> ·

wrote a poetical account of the Second
Punic War. We cannot accuse Horace
of confusing the two Scipios, and (as
Bentley points out) the critical contem-
poraries who heard and read his poems.
of tolerating the confusion. Nor are
the conjectural emendations ‘impendia ⁹
(Cunningham), ⁴ stipendia’ (Doring), ‘In
dispendia ' (Hermannt, likely or ha py.
Bentley condemns the line as a mon ish
interpolation, on metrical as well as
historical grounds. and it is the first and
most obvious victim of those who wish
to reduce the Ode to conformity with
Meineke’s canon: see Index of Metres,
ς 6. It remains to interpret the lines as
they stand, and the difficulties do not
seem to be as great as they have been

the whole comparison. then the buming
of Carthage will be adduced‚ not as his
act, but as the crown and completion by
one of his name of his victories as some-
thing which might be supposed to revive
and keep alive his fame. ‘Not marble
monuments, not his ‘great feats of arms,
not the completest posthumous success
