’ antecedent to the composition. But if this difference must make us
, cautious in drawing sweeping conclusions as to the other Books from
*the obviously conscious and artistic arrangement ¹ of Book iv, we may
’ at least gather that Horace contemplated a collection of poems being
’ read continuously in such a way that the effect of a particular poem
could be heightened or weakened by the sequence in which it was
’ placed; and we may leam something also of the principles of taste
·. which would be likely to guide him in arranging other collections.

3. A marked feature of Horace’s style is the irony with which he
professes to shrink from enthusiasm‚ to be the poet of mirth and love,
‘non praeter solitum levis‚’ surprised, it may be, occasionally into
’ serious subjects, but recovering himself before he has done injury
’ to a theme for which he is unfit². It is this irony as much as the
’ mere desire for variety that makes him scatter his political poems at
Ι such wide intervals. It is this, as we shall see, that colours the pret,
Ϊ lude to Book iv ; and though the relation betweenr. 1 and 1. 2 is not
, worked out so fully as that between 4. 1, 2, 3 and 4. 4, 5, it is substan-
· tially the same. Od. 1. 1 has of course a relation to the whole three
·. Books3 but it is not an accident that a poem, in which his political
ἱ saith is set forth most fully, should follow immediately on his opening
. apology for verse-writing as a taste not more unaccountable than the
thousand others that divide mankind. ²

On its artistic side,—that is where it affects his manner as a
, principle of taste, rather than as a characteristic of his own feelings or
a prudentia} consideration of the judgment of the world‚—this irony
is nearly connected with another feature of his style which will be
⁴ noticed on 2. 19 (Introd. and on v. 31), 3. 5. 56, and 4. 2. 57: Ι
mean his affectation, in poems where we have been wrought higher
1 than usual, of a rather dull, even conventional, ending, as though the
⁸ passion ought to die away in a diminuendo before the strain ceases.
When we are looking for exemplifications of either of these feelings
ξ 2 in the position of a particular Ode, we must remember that they may
’ . pass again by shades hard to define into the mere sense of the relies
s ·. afforded by contrast, an unwillingness to dwell too long on any one
’-· note. An instance, where we cannot doubt an artistic purpose in the
⁴ juxtaposition, and where this purpose seems to hesitate between the
³· first and second feeling which we have traced, is to be seen in 1. 37,
38, where we must notice that the slight Ode‚' with its picture of
