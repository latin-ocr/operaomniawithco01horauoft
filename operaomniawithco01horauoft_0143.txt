gloss as this of Acron’s, which had
really been meant to interpret ‘ anteit.'
‘Anteit ¹ does not seem to require
‘serva.' As Bentley pointed out, it is
not a teehnical term which might be
needed to complete a picture. The
‘anteambulones' or ‘antepedes' were
not ordinarily slaves (Becker’s Gallus,
Exc. B), but poor clients or friends who
ran before their patron to clear the way
for him. ‘Servi’ or ‘ancillae' would
rather follow behind, as ‘pedisequi' or
‘pedisequae’ Doom is made to walk

mand? ‘Necessitas' seems to want
an epithet as in the corresponding pas-
sage (q. v.)‚ Od. 3. 24. 6 ‘Si figit ada-
mantinos Summis verticibus dira Neces-
sitas Clavos.' The nans, etc. belong to
Necessitas: they are not carried by
her for Fortuna. We do not wish‚ even
>'f it were possible, to make too perfect
image of the procession. The details
of one part of it are not really eon-
gruous with those of another. ‘Doom

There is a well—known criticism on
this stanza in a note (30) to Lessing's
Laocoon. 1t seemed to him an instance
in which poetry had suffered from inat-
tention to the laws which distinguish its
functions from those of painting. Itis
a picture, the attributes all appeal to
the eye. In a painting or pieee of
sculpture they would be all seen at a
glauce. The yeffort of mind required to
comprehend them would be very smalh
and in the meantime, as ‘Necessitas'
would be in itself merely an unnamed
female figure, they would be necessary
symbols to convey the alleg gory to the
spectator. Itis different with the poet.
The symbols are not needed to inter-
pret the personification, for he can
speak the terrible name of the power
which he is personifying. They need
interpretation themselves, and their ac-
cumulation wearies, because, though
each costs a fresh effort to the mind,
there is no corresponding distinet addi-
tion to the idea conveyed. What, when
