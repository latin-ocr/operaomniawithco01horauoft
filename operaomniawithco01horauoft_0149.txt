NUNC est bibendum, nunc pede libero
Pulsanda tellus, nunc Saliaribus
Ornare pulvinar deorum
Tempus erat dapibus, sodales.
Antehac nefas depromere Caecubum 5
Cellis avitis, dum Capitolio
Regina dementes ruinas
Funus et imperio parabat
Contaminato curn grege turpium
Morbo ruirorum, quidlibet impotens 10
Sperare fortunaque dulci
Ebria. Sed minuit furorem

1. libero, all restraint on our joy is
removed. For dancing as an expression
of joy see Od. 1. 36. 12 ; for the expres-
sion, ⁸ pulsanda tellus,’ Od. 1. 4. 7; ‘ qua-
tiunt terram: 3. 18. 153 ‘pepulisse ter
pede terram? '

2. saliaribus, 1. 36. 12, ‘fit for the
Salii: as 2. 14. 28 ⁶ mero Pontificum poti-
ore coenis ⁹ ; ‘ in proverbio erat Saliares
coenas dicere opiparas et copiosas! Acr.

- 3. ornare pulvinar, Dict. Ant. s. vv.
⁶ supplicatio‚' ⁴ lectisternium‚' Liv. 5. ·13.

4. tempus erat, ‘ we were right rto
wait; this was the time.‘ —In such uses
of the imperfect there is always reference

to some past thought, though the rela- .

tion of the thought to the leading state-
ment may vary. (1) ‘ It is, all the time,
though we did not think so.' This is
the Greek use of ἄρ’ ἣν. πόθοι καὶ κακῶν
ἄρ’ἦν ns,Soph. O. C. 1697; so Od. 1. 27.
19 ⁸ quanta laborabas Charybdi ’ς so
also negatively A. P. 19 ‘ sed non nunc
erat his locus. (2) ⁶ It is as we thought
truly,’ as here. (3) ‘ So we thought,
but experience shows it is not so ¹: this
is the use in the passages of Ovid often
quoted to illustrate this place: Trist. 4.
8. 5 ‘Nunc erat ut posito deberem fine
laborum Vivere’; and ib. ²4 ‘Me quo-
ι que donari iam rude tempus erat.² This,
again, is like the-Greek use of ἐβουλόμην,
ἐχρῆν, of impossible wishes, and duties
that will not be fulfilled. It should be
'said that the imperfect has been-taken

- here in a simplet sense by Orelli, as

« rebuking the tardiness of the prepara-
tions, ‘dudum oportebat‘; ὥρα δ’ ἧν
πάλαι, Arist. Eccl. 877. This, however,

— weakens the antithesis, ‘nunc. . ‚ante—

hac-⁹ Ritter and Dillr. take it still more
, simply, but less forcibly, as contrasting

the public ‘ supplicatio’ which has al-
ready begun, and which he approveS‚
with the private festivities, ‘nunc est .
bibendum,’ which he enjoins. ⁸ ·

5. antehae, a dissyllabk, as ⁸ ante1t‚’
od. 1. 35· 37·

Caecubum, 1. 20. 9; Epod. 9. 1
‘repostum Caecubum in festas dapes.'

6. cellis avitis, the bins which our
grandsires filled; so it is the oldest as
well as the choicest wine reserved for
such an occasion.

capitolio, the symbol of Rome's
eterna} empire, ‘Capitoli immobile
saxum.' Cp. Od. 3. 3. 42, 3. 5. 12.

7. regina. The title ‘ Regina’ would
be doubly odious to Roman ears. Cp.
Od. 3. 5. 9 ⁴ sub rege Medo,’ and Epod.
9. 12 ⁶ emancipatus feminae! Orelli
notes that coins Of. Cleopatra’s have
been found with the inscription ΒΑΣΙ-
ΛῙΣΣΑ ΚΛΕΟΠΑΤΡΑ, and coins of An-
tony's with the inscriptionx‘ Cleopatrae
Reginae Regum Filiorum Regum?

dementes ruinas, the epithet trans-
ferred from the person to her purpose.
Cp. 1. 3. 40 ⁶ iracunda fulmina.’

sum illum meum funus esse reipublicae.'

9. turpium morbo = ‘ qui turpi morbo
illicitarum libidinum laborabant: Orelli.

10. virorum, κατ’ εἲρὼνειανε* eunu-
chorum.' Cp. Epod. 9. 13.

quidlibet impotens sperare, App.
τ, ξ 2, with no sels-restraint in the
audacity of her dreaming3 ‘impotens’
is a translation of ἀκράτηο.

12. ebria, ‘drunken with the sweet
draught of fortune! Dem. Phil. 1. p. 54

πραγμένων.
