LIBER. EPOD. 5. 339

EPODE V.

Cfflim with her crew of witches‚ Sagana, Veia, and Folia, is engaged in the
tffiwing to her, by spells of rffaffiET‘miserable olff'rffffi'hamed Varus. vv.
1—10, the poem opens with the terrified prayers of a boy. who sees dimly that
the hags have some dreadful intent, though he knows not what. 11-14‚ he is
sdtripped and set in the midst to await their further purposes. 15-24‚ Canidia gives
her orders for the brewing of the magic bowl. 25-28‚ Sagana sprinkles the house
with water from Avernus. 29-4o‚ Veia, meanwhile, is digging 111 the garden
3 hole where, if this spell proves insufficient, the boy is to be buried up to his chin,
and left to starve, that his marrow and liver may be ingredients in a more potent
philtre. 41—46, Folia plays her part in the incantation. What it was is left to
our imaginatiom we are only told of her power—she could draw the moon and
stars from the sky. 47-60, Canidia, half afraid already that her spells are not
successful, appeals to the powers that witness her black arts, that her beloved (an
old fop, on whom she is made to pour contempt in her very prayer) may come to
her. 61-82‚ ‘he comes not; what has happened? No herb has been omitted,
nothing that could make him forget other charms. Aha! she sees it all. He is
under the spell of some more skilful witch. He shall not get off, however. She
has a stronger charm yet to try, and heaven and earth shall change places before
> she lets his love go? 85-102‚ the boy understands her, and interrupts the scene
with a burst of despair, 111 which he threatens his torturers with the vengeance of
spirits and men.

The scene is laid in the interior of a house in Rome, apparently in the Subura;
see on vv. 2 5, 30, 58. A misunderstanding of v. 43, led Porph. to lay the scene at
Naples.

AT, 0 deorum quidquid in caelo regit
Terras et humanum genus,

Quid iste fert tumultus? et quid omnium
Voltus in unum me truces?

1. at, a common particle in exclama-
tions. It implies of course a previous
train of thought of which the speaker is
conscious in himself, or ,which he ima-

being an exclamation. ‘At ’ introducing
the adjuration, marks the change that
has come over him. He can bear it
no longer; he must know what they

gines in another. The exclamation in-
troduced by it is of the nature of an
appeal (⁴ provocatio ad deos ’; cp. Virg.
Aen. 2. 535 ‘At tibi pro scelere, excla-
mat, pro talibus ausis Di,’ etc., and cp.
the use of ἀλλά, e. g. in Aesch. Cho.
306) or of an answer. Here, if with V
and Β and Porph., we read ‘ regit ’ §the
ῗέἶ]ἶῖἓῖζαΐὲὲῗξέςὲἷὲῗ·οῗῖἕεὡξθξέᾱὲζ
but to the witches, the first two lines

mean.

deorum quidquid ; Sat. 1. 6. 1 ‘Ly-
dorum quidquid.’

3. et quid. So apparently V, but the
other MSS. are fairly divided between
‘ et ’ and ⁶ aut ’; Orelli, preferring ⁴ aut,’
compares Epod. 7. 1.

4. unum contrasts with omnium, ‘ so
many against one.' With the construc-
tion ‘ voltus in me ’ cp. Od. 1. 2. 40 ‘ acer
Mauri . . cruentum voltus in hostem?
