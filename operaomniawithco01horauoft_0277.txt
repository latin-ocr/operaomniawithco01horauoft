Summis verticibus dira Necessitas

The full expression will then be, ‘ Every
inch of dry land and the sea is the com-
mon heritage of all? Cp. 2.15.1—4‚
2—18.20—22‘parum locuples continente
npa'; 3. 1. 36⁶ dominus terrae fastidi-
osus?

5- -8. The image in this place is not
clear. We may perhaps compare 2. 18.
29. In both cases Horace is pointing
the irony of fate, which allows a man
to begin to build what he may not live
to finish. In both cases ‘Orcus’ or

· ⁴ Necessitas· are represented under

busy planning his palace. Death has his
measuring rod too, and is planning a
home for him which he shall yet more
surely tenant. Here he is lay ying the
foundations of his palace deep in the
sea; but who knows that Fate may not
snatch his hammer from him and‘ drive

. the last nails into the gable- -top' herself '1’

He will have the toil, but he will not
finish the work himself. Death will
stop him. We may remember that
⁸ nails for building‚‘ ‘ clavi trabales: are
already a recognised implement of ‘ Ne-
cessitas? 1. 35. 18, so that Horace
would say ‘You are building. Fate is
a builder as well as you, and she may
finish your house for you.’ The plui al
⁸ verticibus' may be explained as general-
ising,—‘ the tops of your palaces‚’ for he

. is building in every sea‚-—or of the dif-

ferent points to which the roof rises.
Two other explanations have been given
to ‘summis verticibus.' (1) Bentley’s—
of the nails, ⁴ up to their heads ’ ; (2) that
of most of the older commentators-of
the heads that tower highest, are ⁴ too

of the human proprietor into which
Doom is pictured as driving her nails.

Professor Robinson Ellis has suggested to
me as parallel for this last view ‚.Theogn

in Meineke' s Anal Alexandr. p. 199 Ἡ δ’

κῖησιν Ζηνὶ θεῶν κρείοντι Δίκῃ τ’ ἐπίηρα
φέρουσα. The parallel of Od. 1. 35 seems
to me decisive in favour of the view first
givlen‚ which is supported by Orelli and
Di 11’.

adamantinos, of hardest iron‚ see on
1. 6.·13. It does not help the image of
Fate finishing his work for him, but it
suggests the further idea of the hop e—
lessness of struggling with Fate. Itp is
parallel to the images of 1. 35.16— 20.
See note there.

7, 8. The thought of death and the
(loom of death are both represented as
a halter round the neck, from which
there is no release, if (we should rather
put it in prose—since there is the possi-
bility that) an irreversible Fate has
already fixed the limit of our planS.

12. immetata, ἅπαξ λεγ. The absence
of divisions of property is a character-
istic of the golden age in Virg G. 1.

junction of‘ immetata’ with‘ iugera,'

which is a measure of sursace, has the
effect of an oxymoron.
