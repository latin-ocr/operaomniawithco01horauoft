OD. 3.

Volgarit arcanae, sub isdem
Sit' trabibus fragilemve mecum
Solvat phaselon ; saepe Diespiter
Neglectus incesto addidit integrum: 30
Raro antecedentem scelestum
Deseruit pede Poena claudo.

1. 7. 72. The wording is apparently
stom the verse of Simonides (5 66) ἔστι
καὶ σιγᾶσ ἀκίνδυνον γέρας, which Plu-
tarch (Apophth. Reg. et Imp„ Aug. 7)
mentions Augustus as quoting. The

mysteries of Ceres are used merely as
an illustration-

ODE ΙΙΙ.

-: “ ⁴ De Justt'tia et Constantia). Firmness of purpose is characterized in vv. 1-8. It is
’ the virtue by which Pollux and Hercules, and Augustus and Bacchus, rose to

heaven, by* which Romulus overcame the opposition of Juno, and won immortality
soi-'himself and world-wide empire for Rome. Justice is not absent from the early

, stamas of ,the Ode, for it is a just as well as a firm purpose which is glorified in
⁴ them; butjt is the keynote of Juno's speech, vv. 18-68. She yields to the perse-
v vei-ing purpose of Romulus and of Rome. Her wrath was against the ‘periura

Priami domus‚' the ‘ unjust judge,' v. 19} the promise-breaker‚ v. 22, the violator of

„⁴ the lawsvof hospitality and of marriage, v. 25. They have been punished, and she
is satisfied. As long as beasts of the field hide their whelps on the tombs of Priam
‘v and‘ Paris, the Capitol may stand in its glory, Rome may extend her sway over
the world, only le‘t her leave gold in the mine, send her citizens to the world's end
Ξ in search of empne, not of treasure. And let her beware above all things of the
Ξ ’ dream os rebuilding the doomed city of Troy. Troy rebuilt, Juno’s wrath will
revhre, and the second fall shall be as bad as the first.

T he meaning of the >last wamingjs not clear. Suetonius (Jul. C. 79) mentions

’ among the various causes of Julius Caesar·s unpopularity a rumour ‘migraturum
