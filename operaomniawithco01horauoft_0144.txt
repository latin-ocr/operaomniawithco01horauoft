HORATII CARMINUM

Te Spes et albo rara Fides colit
Velata panno nec comitem abnegat,
>Utcunque mutata potentes
Veste domos inimica linquis.
At volgus infidum et meretrix retro 25
¹‚Periura cedit, diffugiunt cadis .
Cum faece siccatis amici
Ferre ‘iugum ’ pariter dolosi.

na'ils'? Few will dispute the main propo-
sitions of Lessing’s criticism; but we may
notice that Horace does not leave the
interpretation of the symbols to the
unassisted efforts of the mind. The
epithets are an integral part of his
description, and they give at every turn
the moral meaning which sculpture or
painting could only indirectly eonvey.
As Orelli remarks, ‘ae'na manu' is an
addition which poetry only could have
ventured to make, for it involves a
metaphor within the metaphor. The
very sameness from this point of view
'has some force. Horace gives us a
. very detailed picture, but in every fea-
ture he bids us see one and the same
awful character.

21. albo velata panno. The image
seems to be taken from the actual
custom which was observed by the
priests who sacrificed to Fides ofveiling
their hand-in a white eloth, the symbol
expressing apparently at once secresy
(contrast Od. 1. 18. 10 ‘Arcani Fides
prodiga pellucidior vitro ') and guile-
lessness.

rara, i. e. rarely found. The epithet
really reminds us that loyalty is a
quality, and so impairs the personi-
ficati0n‚ cp. Od. 2. 16. 21.

22. comitem abnegat, ‘denies thee
a companion‚’ i. e. the only companion
whom she could deny, viz. herself.
Ovid, possibly in imitation, ‘Si qua
repugnarat nimium comitemque negarat ’
(sc. se), A. A. 1. 127. For the sing.
verb see on Od. 1. 3. 10.

24. immina. >It can hardly ·be de-
nied that some confusion in the allegory
is brought to the sursaceby this epithet.
In this stanza at‘least F ortune is not a
power wholly external to the person
who suffers or rejoices‚ but rather the
genius of his life, ‘mortalis in unum-
Quodque caput, vultu mutabilis.' This
is quite clear from its first lines, for

Hope and loyal friends are said to cling
to her when she changes her garb and
leaves the home of greatness. Hope
and loyal friends are consolations of
adversity, so that Horace must mean
not that they go with F ortune when
she deserts a man, but that they cling
to him, to his changed estate as to his
unchanged. Yet if this is the case, in
what sense is she said to be ‘inimica'i‘
On whom does she frown? A man
deserted by Fortune, suffering under the
illtreatment of F ortune, is a commori
picture, but it is a conception of For-
tune which‚ if it suits the earlier stanzas
os the Ode. is at variance with the
general tone of this one. Fortune,
according to this, does not drive the
great man from his pellace, nor fly from
him and leave him in it to calamity‚
but goes with him. She ‘changes her
garb,' but only as he would himself 3

it is the common Roman habit of '

putting on a sad-coloured dress in a
time of misfortune (cp. Epod. 9. 28
‘ punico Lugubre mutavit sagum ').

26. cadis siccatis, cp. the Greek
proverb ζεῖ χύτρα ζῇ φιλία.

28. ferre iugum pariter dolosi. γ

‘ Ferre ’ depends not on the whole idea
of ‘ dolosi,' but on the positive attribute
which is denied in it. ‘ Not honest in

beafing‚' ‘no loyal yoke—fellows.’ The - Α

metaphor is common. The yoke some·
times, as perhaps here, has a reference
to the labours or troubles that friend·
ship shares and lightens. Aesch. Ag.
842 ἕτοιμος ἦν ἐμοὶ σειραφόρος, St. Paul,
Phil. 4. 3 σύζυγε γνήσιε, Ov. Trist.

times, as Theoc. 12. 15 ἀλλήλους ἐφί-
λησαν ἴσῳ ζύγῳ. it only refers to the
bond of love or friendship which is only

easy when both parties feel its weight ⁶

equally.
