HORATII CARMINUM

Ab se removisse et virilem
Torvus humi posuisse voltum:

Donec labantes consilio patres

Egregius properaret exsul.

Fest. It is in Horace's manner, by a
slight alteration of the common for-
mula, at once to recall and to avoid
a technicality which, if literally repro-
duced, would be harsh or pedantic. See
on 2. 4. 24, 4. 2. 42, 4. 14. Ι, and com-
pare notes on 3. 27. 38. 4. 15. 9. He
refused, according to Cicero, ‘ sententiam
dicere‚’ ‘ to speak in his place,’ ⁴ quamdiu
iureiurando hostium teneretur non esse
Α se senatorem.‘

44. Ar. Rau. 804 ἔβλεψεν οὖν ταυρη-
δὸν ἐγκύψας κάτω.

45. donee .. firma-ret. ⁴ So long as
he was striving to brace up the resolve
of the fathers and to hasten his de-
parture.’ A contrast is intended be·
tween his stem sadness, so long as it
was still doubtful whether the senate
would listen to his counsel, and the
light heart with which, his purpose
accomplished‚ he set out on his return
to turture and death.

46. auctor is opposed constantly
to ‘ suasor.' Sometimes as one who
brings weight and dignity to back his
advice; sometimes as one who ori-
ginates as well as urges a proposal.
The senate acted ‘ auctore Regulo,’ ‘ by
the advice and under the influence of
ReguluS.¹

48. egregius exsul, an oxymoron, as
⁶ splendide mendax,’ 3. 11. 35.

49. atqui sciebat. Cp. the last
sentence of the passage quoted in the
Introd. from the De Officiis, ‘Neque

crudelissimum hostem et ad exquisita

supplicia proficisci, sed iusiurandum ν

conservandum putabat?

52. reditus, plural, as in Epod. 16.
3554. diiudicata lite. 'Cp. Epp. 1. 7. ’
76 ‘ Rura suburbana indictis . . ire La-
tinis.¹ The advice and protection of
clients is represented as one of -the
great burdens of the city life 'of the ’
great in Rome.⁴ (Ep. 1. 5. 31 ‘posticos
falle clientem? etc.) Whether the ⁶ lis,’
which· is now over, is one which the
patron has heard and settled himself, os -
one in which he has been supporting
his client in court, is a question decided
authoritatively each way by about an
equal number of eommentators, but ap-
parently on next to no evidence.

55. Venafranos, see on 2. 6. 16. ,
56Γ Lacedaemonium, 2. 6. 11 ‘reg-
nata Laconi Rura Phalanto? Venafrum
and Tarentum are named as places to
which a Roman would go for his holi-
day. Notice the quiet ending of the
poem, the conventional epithet, raising
no new picture, appealing at the most
to distant historical. associations, seed·
ing not so much the mind as the ear,
and even that with a certain sameness
of sound. This characteristic of Ho-
race’s style is noticed in the Introd. to
