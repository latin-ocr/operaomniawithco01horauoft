ODE VII.

Tm: natural meaning of the Ode is, ‘The world is full of fair spots, but your
J own Tibur is the sairest. Forget your troubles, Plancus; in camp, or here in
a? Tibur, drown mre in wine. Remember how Teucer put a bold face on his
·] calamity‚ and found a new Salamis to make up for the old?

What Planeus’ trouble was we do not know, nor whether it bore any resem-
blance to Teucer's by involving a compulsory absence from his well-loved Tibur.

L. Munatius Plancus was a man of no character, ‘ morbo proditor,' Vell. Pat. 2.
