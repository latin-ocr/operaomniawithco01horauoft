, ⁷ Several occasions have been imagined for this Ode.. The Pseudo-Aer. associated
ᾗ it with the Ludi Seculaoes, ΒΩ. ι7, and it was accordingly treated by several
’ editors as an introduction to the Carm. Sec.

J Franke assigns it to Rc, 28, the year in which Augustus dedicated the temple to
Apollo on the Palatine (Od. 1. 31), and instituted the quinquennial Ludi Actiaci
Ἴ ”” in honour of Apollo and Diana. He thinks the ode was written for their first
· ἰ celebration.

’ Orelli considers it a mere exercise >of fancy, suggested perhaps by some such
“³ occasion as the games of ac. 28, but not of sufficient weight to have been com-
posed for public performance.
