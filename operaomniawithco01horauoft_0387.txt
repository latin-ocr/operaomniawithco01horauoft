Diris agam vos3 dira detestatio
Nulla expiatur victima. 90
Quin, ubi perire iussus exspiravero,
Nocturnus occurram Furor
Petamque voltus umbra curvis unguibus,
Quae vis deorum est manium,
Et inquietis assidens praecordiis · 95
Pavore somnos auferam.
Vos turba vicatim hinc et hinc saxis petens
Contundet obscoenas anus ;
Post insepulta membra different lupi

Et Esquilinae alites ;

Neque hoc parentes heu mihi superstites
Effugerit spectaculum.

tror' = ‘that he, etc.‚will be sent as envoy,
not 1.’ Munro would amend this ver-
sion of the lines by separating ⁶ magnum '
from ‘ fas nefasque‚’ and making it=⁴ id
quod magnum est‚’ ‘ sorceries, such is
⁷ their power, can overset‚’ etc. Of other
interpretations, the best seem to be
those which explain ‘humanam vicem '
by Sallust's ⁴ pecorum vicem obtrunca-
bantur‚’ Cicero’s ‘ Sardanapali vicem
mori‚’ ad Att. 10. 8, ‘after the fashion of
men‚’ ἀνθρώπων δίκην. It would still be
a question whether ‘venena’ was the
object of ‘ convertere ' or the subject of
‘valent.' In the first'case it = ‘veneficae‚'
as ‘ scelus' is used sor a wicked person;
there is an obvious point in refusing
them a more personal appellation, when
the statement is that they have no human
hearts to be moved. The line of thought
then is, ⁸ Conscience cannot move you,
my curses may at least punish you.’ If
'we take it in the second way it will
lmean, ‘The mighty laws of right and
lwrong are not like human things, that
ἶ sorceries should have power to overset
>- them. You may kill me, but Ι shall be
revenged on you yet!

Neither MSS. nor Scholia give any
variations of the text, and none of the
conjectures are attractive. Bentley (who
offers it very hesitatingly) proposes ‘ma-
gica‚’ ⁶ non vertere‚' Haupt ‘ maga non,’
Keller ‘ humana invicem!

89. diris, ‘ curses,’ as in the passage
of Tacitus quoted on v. 85.

dira. detestatio, the solemn denun-
ciation of a curse.

92. Furor seems to be used as a mas-
culine form of Furia. For the idea of the
passage cp. Virg. Aen. 4. 385.

94. deorum mam’um, the spirits of
the dead; literally, according to Curtius,
Grundz. p. 294, the ‘ good ' powers,
⁴ manis ’ being the opposite of ‘immanis’
Cp. Cic. de Leg. 2. 9 fDeorum manium
iura sancta sunto. Hos leto datos divos
habento?

100. Esquilinae, the birds of carrion
that haunted the slopes of the Esquiline,
still the ‘miserae plebis commune sepul-
chrum,' Sat. 1. 8. 10. For the hiatus,
the diphthong being shortened, cp. Sat.
1. 9. 38 ‘Si me amas inquit,’ and such
instances in virgil as Aen. 3. 211 ‘Insu-
lae Ioni0‚’ etc.
