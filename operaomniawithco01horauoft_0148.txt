A sono of triumph, written when the news reached Rome, in September, Β. c. 30,
of the death of Cleopatra and Antony (Dio C. 51. 19). Compare Epod.⁴ 9, which
celebrates their defeat at Aetium in the preceding year. We may note the absence
from both Ode and Epode (see esp. on v. 13) of the name of Antonius. Octavianus
has conquered not a Roman rival, but a -foreign enemy: ‘Senatus Cleopatrae non

Antonio bellum indixerat (Dio C. 50. 6): de ¹illa triumphum non de hoc decrevit
(Dio C. 51. 19).' Ritter. ν

⁴ Now is the time for merriment and thanksgiving‚ private and public; now. and
not before, while the great queen was plotting wild schemes of destruction against*
Rome. Her madness was cooled at the sight of her fleet in flames. Blind panio
became reasonable terror when she fled before Caesar as a dove before a hawk.
Yet she was no vulgar woman. She could brave out her fortune. and look death
in the sace rather than adorn a Roman triumph.’ As Horace paints the fierce
barbaric queen, her recklessness and her fortitude, he is bringing out in stronger
relies the danger from which Rome has been freed, and the glory of Octavianus,
who has conquered no unworthy foe.

-The opening of the Ode was doubtless modelled on the Ode of Aloeeus upon the
death of Myrsilus (Fr. 20, Bergk), of which we have two lines preserved in Athen.
x. p. 430, A:—

πίνηις ἐπειδὴ κάτθανε Μύρσιλοε.
