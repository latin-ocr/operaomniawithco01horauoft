HORATII CARMINUM

Vincunt aequora navitae,

Magnum pauperies opprobrium iubet
Quidvis et facere et pati

Virtutisque viam deserit arduae?

Vel nos in Capitolium, ’

Quo clamor vocat et turba faventium,
Vel nos in mare proximum
Gemmas et lapides, aurum et inutile,

Summi materiem mali,

Mittamus, scelerum si bene poenitet. 50

of parts of Od. 1. 3. Cp. v. 43 with
‘ audax omnia· perpeti,’ etc. The ‘ mer-
cator‘ is always Horace’s type of the

' eager pursuit os wealth. Od. 1. 31. 10

foll„ Epp. 1. 1. 45 foll. To cross the
sea is to fly in the face of·the ‘ prudens
Deus,' who put that bari-ier between
land and land.

ming up the triumph os man's wit. τοῦτο

to the whole sentence is the original

‘Quid leges. .proficiunt’ ἰ’ ‘Horrida
. . navitae’ and‘ magnum . . arduae’ are
both constructed aster ⁴ sil The asyn-
deton serves to point out that the two
last clauses are not fresh instances of
that general thirst sor wealth, which
belies sumptuary laws, but two expla-
nations of the merchant’s boldness: if
the sea is rough the seaman is cunning
(for the relation of the two adjectives
see on 1. 3. ιο) to overcome its diffi-
culties, and in any case there is the pre-
vailing motive behind, the dread of the
one great shame, poverty.

44. arduae, pred. That the hill is
steep is the reason why men turn out of

burst Epod 16. 17‘ Nulla sit hac potior
sententia: etc. The emphasis of posi-
tion and repetition is shared between
vel and n053 ‘'vel ‘'vel emphasising the
indifference of the smaller consideration,

‘anywhere that you please, —give it to
the gods or throw it into the sea; 'and so
the importance of the greater one: ‘only
get quit of it once for all: ‘’no,s ‘’nos
singling out the poet and the audience

whom he addresses from the rest of the
world; ‘let us at least: the‘ melior
pars ’of Epod. 16.

written at the time of Augustus' triple
triumph in 1³.c. 29, but the words need
not imply more than that Horace
already imagines the triumphal proees- ’
sion in which, amid the popular joy, the
mischievous gold will be conducted to
the capitol. Its destination was prob-
ably suggested by the gifts which Augus-
tus had made, or was about to make, to
that temp le. Suet. Aug. 30‘ in cellam

genties H. S. una donatione contulit.⁰

Cp. generally Od. 3. 3. 49-52·

48. gemmas et lapides. For the
same distinction the editors quote Ov. -
de Med. Fac. 20, 21 ‘Conspicuamgem-
mis vultis habere manum: Induitis collo
lapides oriente petitos’; Mart. 11. 50. 4

‘Gemma vel a digito vel cadit aure
lap is? One might fancy from these
lines that‘ gemma’ meant specially a
stone set and gravem and passages are

substantive will mean ‘jewels of every
kind’ ; see above, v. 12.

res publica, summa salus) Orelli, ‘ the
occasion of the chief offending·.²

full metaphor is felt, it would seem to
be of rubbing out the characters on a
