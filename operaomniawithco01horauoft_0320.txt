HORATII CARMINUM

Qui primus alma 'risit adorea,
Dirus per urbes Afer ut Italas
Ceu flamma per taedas vel Eurus
Per Siculas 'equitavit undas.
Post hoe'secundis usque laboribus , 45
Romana pubescrevit, <et impio ’
Vastata Poenorum tumultu
112112 deos habuere rectos,
Dixitque tandem perfidus Hannibal:
Cervi, luporum praeda rapacium,. 50
Sectamur ultro, quos opimus
Fallere et effugere est triumphus.

41. qui primus, the first day of
brightness and victory since Hannibal
began his campaign in Italy. There

cellus in nc. 21'53 but this was the first
decisive‘ victory, the turningp oi'nt of the
war. Appian (p. 344, De Bell. Annib.)
speaks of it as ἰσοστάσιον [τῇ ἐπὶ Κάνναις
ἀηαέιὲἒθα. Τ110 recognised meaning of

‘adorea‚’ was ⁴ glory won 'm war‚' audit
was derived from ‘ador ' = ·.001·11’

‘Gloriam. .a farris honore adoream
appellabantss Plin. N. H. 18. 3. The
original connection is more doubtful.
Pliny explains it of the donative of corn
given to the soldiers after 2 victory,
N. H. 2. 18. Festus, s.v., refers-it, like
such words as ‘ pecunia‚' to an agricul-
tural age: ‘adoream laudem sive glo-
riam dicebant quia gloriosum eum puta-
bant esse qui farris copia abundaret?
Servius on Virg. Aen. 10. 677, has a
still wilder derivation for it, from ‘adoro.'

42. dirus; see on 2. 12. 2.

ut, ‘ ever since‚’ as inEpod. 7. 19, Cic.
Brut. 5 ‘ ut illos libros edidisti nihil a te
postea accepimus.’

43 eeu. This is the only place
where this word is used by Horace.
The images are of the speed and vic-
toriousness of Hannibal’ s progress: ‘like
fire through a pine· ·so‚rest or the east
wind sweeping the Sicilian sea?

44. Siculas3 see on 2. 12. 2. Horace
may be resen-ing to his own experience

(see 3. 4. 28), but it is also possible that
both the ‘Sici lian' waters and the

metaph of‘ equitavit’ are due to Eur.
Phoen ²09 περιῤῥύτων ὑπὲρ ᾆκαρπίστων

πεδίων Σικελίας Ζεφὺρου πνοαΐε ἱππεύ-
σαντος, era-Ji. In its simple sense, and

as a matter of construction, the verb ’ ⁴

belongs to Hanniba13metaphorically
and wgisth a zeugma, it supplies also ’the
verb os‘ flamma' and‘ Eurus.

grew ever more and more successful 111

. its enterpn'ses; the ablative as in 3. 30.

8⁸ cresoem laude!

46. impio, because they affronted
Roman gods.

47. Poenorum tumultu. A ‘·tu
multus‘ was a sudden and dangerous
war on or within the hordeis, usually a
Gallie or Italian one. Cicero explains
its nature iu Phfl. 8. 1. Cp. especially,

‘Itaque maiores nostri tumultum Itali
cum quod erat domesticus tuinultum
Gallicum quod erat Italiae finitimum
praeterea nullum tumultum nominabant?
The expression, then, in the text is 21-
mostanoxymoron‚‘awarwithCa1-thagin-
ians, but yet a war in otu· own bordei-sl

48. deos rectos, of the images thrown
down by Hannibal, and now set on
their pedestals again.

49. The speech of Hannibal is founded

on the saying actually attributed to him =

by Livy on learning of Hasdrubd’s
defeat and death: ‘tanto simul publico “
familiarique' ictus luctu, agnoscent se
fortunam Karthaginis fertur ᾱωεξ
Liv. 27.51.

perfidus. It was the stock
against him. Livy speaks of his ‘
dia plusquam Punica: 21. 4.

51 ultro, agressively, neefflessly.

opimus triumphu& araretriumpw
a phrase coined by Horace to the model
of‘ spolia opimal'* .
