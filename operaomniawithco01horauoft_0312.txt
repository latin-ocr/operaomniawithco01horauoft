'derance of good authorities. ‘ Tuque’
is found,in some MSS. of secon‘dary
value, and adopted by Ritter ; ‘ procedit ’
is found in the Berne MS. having been
proposed, in ignorance of that fact, by
Heinsius, and supported by Bentley.
To whom does the pronoun refer '1‘ Only
two answers worthy of consideration
have been given. (1) To Antonius. In
favour os this is the fact that ‘te ¹ at the
beginning of the next stanza, undoubt-
edly belongs to him, and it is unlike
Horace‘s finished workmanship to put
the same pronoun in an emphatic place
in· two consecutive stanzas, when the
subjects to which it refers are wholly
different, Against it must be ⁴counted
the necessity which it involves of ac-
cepting‚..on very slender authority, the
reading ‘tuque‚’ and the difficulty of
putting any satisfactory meaning on
‘dum procedis! Newman-thinks that
Antonius would ride in Augustus' cha-
riot as a member of the imperial family,
by marriage with Marcella. Ritter, *that
he would. take part in the processioa as
praetor (this would oblig'e us to post-

, pone the date of theOde to ac. 13).

Bentley seems really to dispose in ad-
vanee of both suggestions. Antonius’
place in the pmcession, if he had one,
could hardly be im rtant enough to
bear the weight of t 's stanza.
procedis: with no qualification or hint
that the eries of triumph were not for
him, could hardly be said of any person
but the triumphing general. (2) To
‘Triumphus' the triumph personified.

along! The only serious objection to
it is the separation before noticed of
the ⁸ te ' of this stanza from the ‘ te ’ of
the next. Bentley objects, also, that we
aretaking ‘io Triumphe ' in two different
senses3 in the first line as in the poet’s
mouth, in the second ‘materialiten’ as
the cry to be uttered by the people.
But this is hardly true. The construc-
tion in both cases is ‘tedicemuz io

—‘ Evoe Bacche ¹ is at once the actual

sziumphe! ‘Io Triumphe ' is an invo-
cation of the nified Triumph·god;

,it is also the affl cry uttered. Bentley

ought equally to object to Virgil’s ⁸ Evoe
Bacche fremens, solum te virgine dig-
num Vociferans,' Aen-:- 7. 389, where
of Amata and the vocative case whgg
explains the ‘te dig-num’ (not ‘tu
dignus es ¹), in which the poet, not
Amata, is the direct speaker. For ‘io

Triumphe’ as the cry raised as the pro- ,

cession along (it was an old cry,
and not originally limited to triumphant
processions, for it occurs in the Hymn
of the Fratres Arvales), cp. inter ,a1. Ov,

held to involve a personifimtion of
Triumphus, appears from Livy's exproe-
sion 45. 38 ⁸ [Milites] triumphum nomine ,

‘procedit' rather improves-the stanza,
by giving it a more continuous connec-
tion with the last. ‘It is Caesar's
triumph that will unlock my voice, as it
will of that of all Rome '- and there is
more obvious motive in the ‘·te,’ helped

by the corruption to ‘.tu,’ for altering ·
.the third person to the second, than viee

versa. Bentley, dissatisfied (and it must
be admitted, after all, with some reason)
with both these interpretations, cuts ffie ,
knot by reading ‘Isque dum procedit:

of Caesar.

, 51. cavitas omnis ‚seems to add the ¹

climax⁴ to vv. 33-44 of Antonius' share

3,in the rejoieings, and vv. 45-48 of Ho-

raoe’s own, and to prepare the way for

the division again of their duties in the ·
sacrifices. ‘We will shout together 111 ,

the shouting town, but when we come
to offer our- flaank-offerings, we shalr be
as unequal as we* were in our poetieat
offering, ten bulls and cows for you, and
a little oels for me.’
