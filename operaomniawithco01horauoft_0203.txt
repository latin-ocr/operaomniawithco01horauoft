O DE XIX.

γ Tim poet imagines himself (vv. 1-4) to have come, while wandering in the hills,
on Bacchus amidst the Nymphs and Satyrs. He describes dramatically (as though
he felt them at the moment) the effects of the sight: the fresh terror (χαλεποὶ δὲ
θεοὶ φαίνεσθαι ἐναργεῖς, Hom. 11. 20. 131), the msh of inspiration; delightful. yet

half painful, from its tumultuous excitement. Then he finds the way of relies.
⁴¹ He may sing the *praises of Bacchus; of his power to bless those whom he loyed
and destroy his enemies ς his power over inanimate nature, over noxious beasts‚
over the giants, over the monsters of Hades.
,Δ Compare Od. 3. 25. They both seem to be attempts to catch something of the
5 Ι inspiration of a Greek dithyramb. That Ode has a purpose3 the present one is
³ ¹ a mere study. There is no reason to believe that it is a reproduction of any single
original. The art of its composition, the climax through which the celebration of
Bacchus’ triumph rises, and the studiedly quiet conclusion 'after the abrupt bursts
of the beginning, as though the strained mind had found relief and the ‘ turbida
laetitia’ run itself clear, are Horatian rather than Greek.

Dillr. suggests that Horace had been lately reading Euripides' Bacchae. That
he had read it is pretty certain. ³
