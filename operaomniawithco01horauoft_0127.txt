of death by the argument that those
do not escape whom you would most
‘You, the philoso-
ΡῙιει5, (10 not escape) Archytas ι5 sup-
posed to bring the same lesson home to
the sailor by another argument. ‘The
forms and occasions of death are many;

your own trade has its dangers3 the
young die as well as the old3 the only

’ “’ fixed thing is that all die. 1' died like

the rest, cast ashore‚ as you might be,
by a tempest. Bev not in such a hurry
after your gain as to resuse me the last
rites. You will not be unpunished if

“ you do?

17. spectacula. The metaphor is
. from gladiatorial shows; wars are the
‘ludi' in which Mars delights‚ Od. 1. 2.
37. The Furies are represented as
stirring up war in Virg. Aen. 7. 324
foll„ 12. 845 foll.

18. avidum, a,few MSS. read ‘avi-
dis’, · but even if we want, as we do 011
Dillenburger’s interpretation, a hit at
the trader’ s eagerness for gain, ‘avidis’
is neither so delicate nor so forcible as

‘avidum,' which means‘ greedy as they';
ep. Od. 2. 18. 30‘ rapacis Orci,¹ where
the epithetis clearly meant to compare
the greediness of death for his prey
with the greediness of the rich landlord
who' 1s laying field to field.

2ο. saeva, Od. 1. 19. 1, perhaps with
a reminiscence of the Homeric epit t,het
[ἔπ]αινὴ Περσεφόνεια.

eaput fugit. None could die (acc.
to Virg. Aen. 4. 698) till Proserpine
had cut a lock of hair from his head3
the idea being that the dying man was

Ἰ. a victim offered to the powers below

(⁴ victima Orci? Od. 2. 3. 24), as it was
usual to begin a sacrifice by cutting
some hairs from the forehead of the vic-
tim and burning them, Virg. Aen. 6.

245. Cp. Eur. Alc. 74, where Θάνατος

says, στείχω δ’ ἐπ’ αῧτὴν ὡς κατάρξωμαι

ξίφει· Ι ἱερὸς ’γὰρ οὗτος τῶν κατὰ χθονὸς
θεῶν Ι”’ οτου τόδ’ ἔγχος κρατὸς ἁγιάσῃ
τρίχα.

fugit. The perf. tense, as Od.2. 13
20‘ leti vis rapuit rapietque gentes?

21. devexi Orionis. On'on’s set-
ting is a time proverbial for bad

weather, Od. 3. 27. 18, Epod. 15. 7, ²·

Virg. Aen. 7. 719.

comes, Od. 4. 12. 1.

22. Illyricis, for the Adriatic gene-
rally, as Virg. Aen. Ιἰ 243.

23. at tu answers, perhaps, the em-
phatic ‘ te’ of v. 1, ⁴ You have lectured
me, now hear what I have to say to
you.’

ne parce malignus, ‘ grudge not
churlishly’; he puts it as though avarice
could be the only reason for his refusing.

vagae adds a touch, ⁶ surely the sand
that drives hither and thither before the
wind won⁷t eost you much.’ It is time‚
however, rather than sand, that he
doubts his sparing; ‘ parce dare’ as

‘parce cavere‚’ Od. 3. 8. 26.

24. For the hiatus, cp. Epod. 13. 4
⁴ Threicio Aquilone⁰; Virgil s ‘Actaeo
Aracyntho,' Ecl. 2. 24 etc.

Odz5. sio, i.e. if you do as Ι ask; see on

. 1. . 1.

quodeunque minabitur, sor the
personification, cp. Virg. ¹ G. 1. 462
⁶ quid cogitet Auster.’

26. fluctibus Hesperiis. Does this
mean‘ on the other side of Italy when
you get round there, ‘may the east
wind spend its force on the forests of
Apulia as it crosses Italy' ἰ’ or do the
words not necessarily imply that the
trader will himself be sailing on the
Hesperian waves? The east wind 15 on
an errand of vengeance against the
waves of the west, it is dangerous to
come in his course. The form of ex-
pression is dictated by the love of ver-
bal antithesis, but there is the notion of
