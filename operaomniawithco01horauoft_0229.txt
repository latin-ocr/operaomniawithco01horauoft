ODE V.

‘JOVE's thunder proves him the sovereign of the sky. Augustus shall prove
himself a god upon earth by adding to the empire Britain and the hateful
Parthians—O shame to think of the disgrace not yet wiped away i-Roman
soldiers living as captives, forgetful of name and country, and country's gods.
This was the danger that Regulus foresaw if prisoners were allowed to hope for

. ransom—“Let them die,’' he said, “and pity them not. Ι have seen with my
. own eyes the sight of shame: Roman standards nailed up in Punic temples with

armour that was taken not from the dead but from the living z—Roman citizens
with their hands bound behind their baeks—Carthage peaceful and busy :-—the
work of our war undone. Will you buy those soldiers back again? It will be a

¹waste of money. The deer caught in the net does not fight again if you loose it,

nor does the man who has once feared death make a soldier again. He does not
know what war means.'' He put aside his wife and children, and hung his head
as one disgraced, till the senate listened to his advice; then he went back to tor-
ture and death with as light a heart as if he were going for a holiday.’

other phase of Augustus' rule. He is to retrieve the deeply-selt disgrace of
&aa and to restore the healthy military spirit of ancient Rome. We have in
the s ory of Regulus at once a measure of the disgrace to be retrieved,⁸—‘ It is the
very disgraee which he feared and foretold and went back to the torture in order
to prevent‚’—and a picture of the true Roman spirit which is to be reawakened.

The whole sentiment of the speech may be compared with Liv. 22. 59-61.

The story of Regulus? mission to Rome is not found in Polybius, a fact which
has been held to throw doubt on its truth. It is summarized in the Epitome of
Liv. 18. With Cicero it is a commonplace. It is told at length in the De Off. 3.
27, a passage of which Horace recalls several turns of thought and expression.
⁴ M. Attilius Regulus, cum consul iterum in Africa ex insidiis captus esset, duce
Xanthippo Lacedaemonio, imperatore autem patre Hannibalis Hamilcare, iuratus
missus est ad senatum ut nisi redditi essent Poenis captivi nobiles quidam rediret
ipse Karthaginem. Is curn Romam venisset utilitatis speciem videbatz sed eam,
ut res declarat, falsam iudicavit: quae erat talis; manere in patria, esse domi suae
cum uxore, cum liberis; quam calamitatem accepisset in bello, communem for-
tunae bellicae iudicantem, tenere consularis dignitatis gradum. Quis negat haec
esse utilia? Quem censes? Magnitudo animi et fortitudo negat. Num locuple-
