xx INTRODUCTION.

more or less skilful, to fill up a gap in the original authority; and
this once believed, a scholar of the 16th or 17th centuries may not
unreasonably think himself as competent to guess the riddle as a
scholar of the 4th or 5th. It is manifest that no impassable barrier
separates cases where the MSS. are divided from those where they are
consentient. Division is only a sign of the disease. We have already
seen that it is confessedly possible for the same blunder to infest
every MS. A modern editor will probably set aside, as a rule, purely'
conjectural emendations; at any rate, he will hesitate to give them
the reality which is implied by printing them in the text3 not because
he denies the possibility of corruptions, or does not feel the plausi-
bility of many conjectures, but only because experience has taught us
that there is no necessary limit even to the cleverest and most plau-
sible guessing, and because it cannot be proved that in such a text as
that of Horace guessing on a large scale is necessary. One more
remark may be allowed. An editor with the feelings which I have “
described will yet feel bound to recall, and to some citent to discus8‚
the more famous conjectures which have become part of the literary ’
history of his author, and in doing so he will run the risk, at times, of
seeming to treat great names ungraciously. It must be remembered
therefore that to have learnt to distrust a method is not to deny the
genius of those who used it, and who, by showing us its results at its
ἲ best, have taught us the limits os its capability. The solid value of
’ζ Bentley's edition is diminished very little, if at all, by the fact that very
'i many of his conclusions are such as we cannot now accept with any ,
ἰ-(;οῐι[ἱ(κπιετε or even accept at all. There is hardly a question in
Horatian exegesis that is not raised by him, and raised, if at times in
a form rather more logical than befits the criticism of a poet, yet
always with a precision and strength, as well as with a fulness of
knowledge, which at least (and it is an editor's chief function) makes
us understand and measure the difficulty.
2. To the constructive criticism of previous centuries has been ,
ξ added in the present one the destructive criticism of which the chief
ᾖ examples are to be found in the edition of H. Peerlkamp (Harlem‚
³ 1854; Amsterdam, 1862) and in the work of Gruppe, Minos: iiber
die Interpolationen in den romischen Dichtern, Leipzig, 1859. This,
like the former, proposes to carry us back beyond the age of MSS. or
Scholia: unlike the former, it cannot even appeal to indications of
disturbance in the MSS. which would explain, if they did not require,
its theories. The antecedent probability of defects in the archetype

wrongly filled up cannot be denied in the face of evidence that such
