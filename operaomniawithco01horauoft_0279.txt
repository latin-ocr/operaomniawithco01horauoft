25. -1t appears from Porph. that in
his time some copies marked the be-
ginning of a new Ode here, for he con-
demns such a division. See on Od.
1. 7. 15 and Epod. 2. 23. ¹

26. civicam, ‘ o'f citizens against citi-
zens? See on 1. 2. 21 ‘audiet cives
acuisse serrum.'

²7· Pater urbium. It is impossible
to doubt that Horace had in mind the
historic title of great patriots, ‘Pater
Patxiae: which, though it had not yet
been conferred on Augustus by the
vSenate, may yet have been currently
given to him by his partisans (see on
1. 2. 5o); but the form ¹ Pater urbium’
is taken rather from the more special
designations given to their benefactors
by particular towns. Orelli quotes an
inscription to Augustus from Jadera, a
colony in Illyria, IMP. CAESAR. mvi F,
AUG. rmus comunis MURUM m· ’ruimus
Cicero bids his brother (ad
Q. Fr. 1. 1) deserve the title of ⁶ parens
Asiae! This general benefactor is to
be recognised as such from city to city,
to have in each his statue with the
memorial of his public services.

28. subscribi, i. e. to have his name
inscribed at the bottom of the statues.

29. refrenare licentiam, cp. 4. 15. 9.
where Horace proclaims that Augustus
has accomplished this task, ⁴ ordinem
Rectum evaganti frena licentiae Iniecit.’

30. quatenus, ‘ since,’ Sat. 1. 1. 64,
2. 3. 76, Juv. 12. 102 3 not found before
Horace.

31, 32. For the sentiment cp. 2. 1. 10-
14, and the verses attributed to Menan-
der: Δεινοῖ γὰρ ἀνδρὶ πάντες ἐσμὲν εὐκλεεΐ
Ζῶντι φθονῆσαι κατθανόντα δ’ αἰνέσαι.

32. quaerimus, ποθοῦμεν, ⁶ requiri-
mus‚' ‘ we look for without finding?

invidi goes with both clauses; it is
the clue to the apparent inconsistency.

33. querimoniae, lamentations in
the senate, in society, in literature, over
the evils of the time.

35. leges sine moribus, cp. 4. 5. 22,
where Augustus is represented as hav-
ing touched both springs of reformation:
⁶ Mos et lex maculosum edomuit nefas!

37, 338. pars, 1atus; cp. 3. 3. 55 ‘ Qua
parte debacchentur ignes'; 1. 22. 19
‘ Quod latus ,mundi nebulae malusque
Iuppiter urget!

37. inclusa, ‘ senced in.' as if the
heats were intended to bar it from
human intrusion. ⁴ Terra domibus ne-
gata‚' ibid. Virg. Aen. 7. 227 ‘ si quem
. . dirimit plaga. solis iniqui.'

39. solo, ablative of place.
