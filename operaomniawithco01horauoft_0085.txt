Ἴ ’ἮΗΑΤ man wilt thou sing of, Clio? what demigod? what god ?—-sing of, till
2 the hill of Helicon rings his name again, or the woods of Haemus follow to listen,
Ἰ ιε they did when Orpheus sang? What god, but Jove first, and Pallas next, Liber
’ῃ Diana. Phoebus. For demigods, Hercules and the Twin Brethren who calm the
stormy sea. And of men: Romulus and all the Roman worthies; Marcellus, the
⁴ lusti-e of whose name grows with each generation; the Julian house, which out-
shines all others as the moon outshines the stars; Augustus, the hope of the
human race, the vicegerent of Jove himself.’

The stamework of the Ode is suggested by the opening of Pind. Ol. 2 :—

ἆναξιφόρμιγγεσ ὕμνοι
τίνα θεόν, τίν’ ἥρωα, τίνα δ’ ἄνδρα κελαδήσομεν;

Ι But after the question has been asked the resemblance ceaseS. In Pindar it is,
answered immediately: ‘The godis Zeus, the hero Hercules, the man Theron,'
. and all three are directly connected 'with the Olympian victory which Theron
π has won.

' On the date of this Ode, see Introd. to Odes i-iii. § 2.

The arguments as to the latest time at which it can have beenwwritten or
,3 published seem irresistible. It cannot have been aster Marcellus’ untimely death
’ in the autumn of ne. 2 3. The earliest date is commonly fixed by his marriage with
’ Julia in Rc. 25, when Augustus adopted him as his son. The Ode links his name
too closely to the Julian house to have been written before Augustus had given
·' final and unmistakable proofs of his intentioris towards him.

QUEM virum aut heroa lyra vel acri
Tibia sumis celebrare, Clio?
Quem deum? Cuius recinet iocosa
Nomen imago
Aut in umbrosis Heliconis oris 5
Aut super Pindo gelidove in Haemo?
Unde vocalem temere insecutae
Orphea silvae,

- 1. lyra. vel aori tibia, see on Od. 1. 3. iocosa imago, Od. 1. 20. 73 in
’ = 1. 32, and on 3. 4. 1. neither case is any specially sreakish
J 2. sumis celebrare, App. 2. ξ 1. echo intended. '

'⁴1 Clio, see on Od. 1. 1. 32. 5. oris, not confined to the sea-
’- 3-6. Clio is to sing, not Horace, and shore, Od. 1. 26. 4.

‘haunts on Helicon (in Boeotia), on, song. He implies, ‘let your song be
ζ ΧΡίιιᾱιιε (in Thessaly, Virg. E. 10. 11), such as that:

οι· on Haemus, the old home of Orpheus 7. temere, ‘ pell-mell,' ⁵ nullo ordine,‘
·, (in Thrace, Virg. G. 2. 488). in their hurry to hear.
