41. ‘Like lionesses that have come
on a herd of calves, are rending, ah mel
each her own! She imagines what is
even now passing in each chamber.
‘ Lacerant ’ continues the image of the
lionesses; the simile passes into a meta-

,actually bury her, and imagines

should put disjunctively as alternative
possibilities which cannot be ralioed at
the same time. See on Od. 1. 3.9‚3.
