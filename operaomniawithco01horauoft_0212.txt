HORATII CARMINUM

Delenit usus nec Falerna
Vitis Achaemeniumque costum,
Cur invidendis postibus et novo κ 45
Subliffle ritu moliar atrium?
Cur valle permutem Sabina‘
Divitias operosiores?

43. neue, like other expressions of
the Ode, seems to be due to Virg. G. 2.
466 , ‘ N ec casia liquidi corrumpitur
usus olivi.’ Conington (in loc.) points
out that the two constructions are not
exaetly parallel. The ‘ wearing of pur-
ple ' is the· subject of ⁵ delenit' in sense
as well as grammar; but the hypallage
which makes ‘ sidere clarior ' agree with
· ‘usus’ rather than with ‘purpurarum’
(cp. 3. 21. 19 ‘iratos regum apices,’ and
Epod. 10. 12 and 14), is the same as
that by which virgil attributes to the
‘usus olivi' the adulteration which hap-
pened to the oil itself.

44. Achaemenium, Persian. See
on 2. 12. 21. ι

45. invidendis, 2. 10. 7 ‘caret invi-
denda Sobrius aula!

novo ritu, ⁸ after the modern fashion? ’
Cp. Od. 2. ¹5- 10—20, 2. 18. 1-5. The
‘atrium’ was the reception room of a
great house (cp. Epp. 1. 5. 31 ‘Atria
servantem postico salle clientem ’), and.
the chief care was spent on its adorn-
ment; so that the ideas of the two
lines will be exactly parallel to Virg.
G. 2. 461-463 ‘Si non ingentem foribus
domus alta su rbis Mane salutantum
totis vomit ae ibus undam, Nec varios
inhian't pulchra testudine postes? ..

on 1. 17. 2 ‘Lucretilem mutat Ly-'
