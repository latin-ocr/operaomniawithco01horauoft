64 HORATI Ι CARMINUM

Et lasciva Licentia

Finitis animum reddere amoribus.
Urit me Glycerae nitor
Splendentis 'Pario marmore purius:
Urit grata protervitas
Et voltus nimium lubricus adspici.
In me tota ruens Venus
Cyprum deseruit, nec patitur Scythas ιο
Et versis animosum equis
Parthum dicere nec quae nihil attinent.
Hic vivum mihi caespitem, hic
Verbenas, pueri, ponite thuraque
Bimi cum patera meri: 15
Mactata veniet lenior hostia.

3. Licentia, ⁶ freedom of lise‚' as Ca-
tullus, 51. 13, traces his passion to
‘otium‚' ‘Otium Catulle tibi molestum
est,' etc.

5. nitor, Od. 3. 12. 5 ‘Liparaei nitor
Hebri,’ ‘ brighfflaeautyf

8. lubricus, a fa'ce to look on which
is to slip from your resolve. The meta-
phorical use of ‘lubricus’ in the sense
of ‘hazardous’ is common in Cicero.
. For the infin. see App. 2. ξ 2.

10. The Scythians. with the Parthians
and the Spaniards, represent to Horace
the foreign politics of the time, the glory
that Augustus’ arms were always about
to win or had won, cp. Od. 2.11. 1, 3. 8.
16, etc„ and Introd. to Odes i-iii. ἐξ 7, 8.

11. versis equis, Od. 2. 13. 18 ‘sa-
gittas et celeris fugam Parthi’ ; Virg. G.
3. 31 ‘ F identemque fuga Parthum ver-
sisque sagittis.’

12. neo quae nihil attinent, ‘nor
aught that is irrelevant‚' sc. to her,
and to love, to my proper themes: that
he does not add such a qualifioetion
may be possibly meant to show that he
is already absorbed in the thoughts os
love3 he is no longer speaking of them
from outside.

13. vivum caespitem, a fresh cut

turf for a temporary altar. Od. 3. 8. 4
‘ acerra thuris Plena . . positusque carbo
in Caespite vivo?

14. verbenas, Od. 4. 11. 16 ‘ata
castis vincta verbenis; ’· Virg. Aen. 12.
120 ‘verbena tempora vincti’ ;Virg. E.
8. 65 verbenas adole pingues et mascula
thura.’ Explained (by Servius on Virg.

Aen. 1. c.‚ Donatus on Ter. Andr. 4.3. 11, >

and Acron on this place) as the name
of all green things, boughs or leaves of
myrtle, bay. olive, etc„ or even

gathered‘ ex puro loco’ and used' ιιι a '
religious rite. The quotations given '
show that they were used for several Δ

purposes in a sacrifice.
1.5 bimi. New wine was used in
sacrifices, cp p. Od. 1. 31. 2, 3. ²3- 33

‘ bimi' will therefore probably mean ’
‘last year’s wine.’ which would be used ,

till the wine of the year was ready.

meri, wine with any admixture of
water was unfit for religioususes. Fest. γ

s. v. ‘spurc'umff .
16. veniet lenior, opposed to‘ in me ,

tota mens? V. 9. The overpowering aad jgj
painful ‘ afflatus’ os a god was a sign of
disfavour rather than of favour, and ς’
would be mitigated by submission and ⁷

reverence. See Od. 2. 19.
