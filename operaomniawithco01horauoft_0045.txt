oDES, BOOKs 1-111. 3

we are on less safe ground. A very few can be fixed with'exactness.

” Such are 1. 31, which is written for the dedication of the temple of

Apollo Palatinus in 13.c. 283 2. 4, which Horace dates himself in
13.c. 25, by reference to his own age ; 1. 24 and 3. 14, both of which
are fixed to 1³.c. 24, the one by the known date of the death of Quin-
tilius, the other by the return of Augustus from Spain. We may
perhaps add a few, though in their case of course more latitude must
be given, which speak in terms of near anticipation of political events
which can themselves be dated. Such are 1. 35, which represents
Augustus as on the point of starting for Britain, a purpose for which
we know that he set out from Rome in nc. 27 (see Introd. to that
Ode, Dio 53. 22, 25) ; and 1. 29, which seems to refer to prepara-
tions more or less immediately preceding Aelius Gallus' expedition
into Arabia Felix in 13.c. 24. Such again are the Odes (2. 15 and 3.
6) in which we can hardly doubt‚the reference to the restoration of
temples which Augustus undertook in the year 28. ’

§ 4. Those who would go much beyond this in fixing with accuracy
the date of single Odes have to lean a good deal on Horace's references
to events on the frontier and beyond it, movements of the Cantabrian,
the Scythiam the Parthian. In estimating the value of these it is of
course necessary to be sure of the nature of the allusion. We are in
danger of confusing poetry with history when we look too closely into
every mention of Dacian or Indian and search the pages of Dio or
Strabo for some detail that will exactly suit· it. Horace's verses are

, full of the feeling of the greatness of the Roman empire, the remote-

ness of its frontiers‚ the immense charge which Caesar has taken on
himself. And the names of distant and unknown places‘and tribes
had a spell in ancient times which they have lost in days of maps and
geography. Even when we come to more definite references, as
those to the quarrels of Phraates and Tiridates, or to the frequent
risings of the Cantabri, though we have here ample ground for dating
generally the period during the course of which the poems must have
been composed‚ and exactly, if we know the date of a special event

⁷ referred to, the year before which the particular poem could not have

been composed‚ we yet soon get to the point where the event has
become a standing illustration of the vicissitudes of fortune or a.
statesman’s anxieties, a poetical commonplace which may recur till it
is⁴ supplanted' by some fresh circumstance which strikes the poet's
imagination.
To this it must be added that the foreign history of the time is
