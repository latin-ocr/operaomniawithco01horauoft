266 HORATII CARMINUM

ODE ΙΙ.

some greater poet such as you must sing his triumph,-Caesar‚ the best and
greatest gift which heaven ever gave to earth, even in the golden age, our joy at
receiving him back, our games, our holiday. Even I may find a voice then amid
the happy multitude, We will all shout and rejoice and offer incensu you will

Julus Antonius was the son of the Triumvir by Fulvia. and was edueated by his
step-mother Octavia. Through her protection he was spared when his brother
Marcus Antyllus was siaiu, and rose eventually to high& avour with Augustus, and
was married to Marcella, Octavia's'daughter, after h 'iiivorce from Agrippa in
ιο. 21. Horace's Ode is the only ancient authority for‘ his having been a poen ⁶
but the Pseudo-Acron vouehes for his having written an excellent Epic poem in ’
twelve Books, called the Diomedeia, some years afterwards. He was made praetor
in nc. 13, and consul in nc. 10. In me. ² he was condemned to death ou the
‘charge of adulterous intercourse with Julia. ’

On the bearing of the Ode see Introd. p. 258. It does not follow, of course,
that the Ode was written aster the later Odes. It may well be, as F ranke thinks,
that the omission of any reference to the successes of Tiberius and Drusus makes it
improbable that it was written aster the year 1 5.

With the form of the Ode, refusing praise in word, yet gmnting it in the act of
refusal both directly and indirectly, comp. 1. 6, and 1. 12.
