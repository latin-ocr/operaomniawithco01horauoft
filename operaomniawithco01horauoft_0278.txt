HORATII CARMINUM

Fruges et Cererem ferunt,
Nec cultura placet longior annua, .

Defunctumque laboribus

15

Aequali recreat sorte vicarius.

Illic matre carentibus

Privignis mulier temperat innocens,

, Nec dotata regit virum

Coniux nec nitido fidit adultero. 20
Dos est magna parentium ,
Virtus et metuens alterius viri

Certo foedere castitas3 ,

Et peccare nefas aut pretium est mori.

13. Fruges et Cererem, ἓν διὰ δυοῖν,
probably like ⁸ gemmas et lapides,’ v.
48; the double substantive is meant to
express universality, ‘fruits of the ground
of every kind? “

14—16. This is best illustrated by
Caesar’s description (B. G. 4. 1) of the
Suevi, from whom it is possible that
Horace has transferred it to the Scy-
thians. ‘ Suevi centum pagos habere
dicuntur, ex quibus quotannis singula
milia armatorum bellandi causa ex fini-
bus educunt. Reliqui qui domi manse-
rint se atque illos alunt. Hi rursus
invicem -anno post in ‘armis sunt, illi
domi remanent. Sic neque agricultura
nec ratio atque usus belli intermittitur.
Sed privati ac separati agri apud eos
mhil est; neque longius anno remanere
uno in loco incolendi causa licet?

14. neo cultura placet, etc„ seems
therefore possibly to include the two
ideas that no individual was employed
111 tillage for more than a yaer together,
and that the same piece of ground was
not tilled for more than a year. ‘ None
cares to till the soil for more than a
single year, and when one has fulfilled
h1s toil a successor relieves him on the
same terms of service?

t 16. aequali sorte, sc. for a year's
urn.
