grata, ‘ pleasant,’ to own or to see.

6. A villa adorned with gold and
ivory; cp. Od. 2. 18. 1 ⁸ Non ebur neque
⁷ aureum Mea renidet in domo lacunar.’

7. rura, i.e. as the next stanza shows,
the wine-growing lands through which
ἱ the Liris (now the Garigliano) flows. On
· the lest bank of the Liris, as it nears the
Δ sea, is the Ager Falernus, and' at a short
distance the Mons Massicus.

8. mordet, Lucret. 5. 257 ‘ ripas
radentia flumina rodunt!

9. ⁵ Let who may own rich vineyards
at Cales, I grudge them not.’

premant = ⁸ reprimant,’ check the
luxuriant growth; Virg. G. 1. 156 ‘ ruris
, opaci Falce premes umbram.’ The
>words are probably meant to imply the
· richness of the soil and luxuriance of
the vines. Cales was a town in the
north of Campania. Its wine is named

in Od. 1. 20. 9, 4. 12. 14.
ι Calena. falce (cp, 3. 6. 38) involves a
. slight hypallage, i.e. the adjective would
’ more naturally go with ‘vitem’ ‘At
Cales’ is the simple ‘meaning When
· for the local case or adverb an adjec-
tive is substituted‚ there are possibly
‚ several words in the sentence with
¹ which it may without positive impro-
priety be made to agree. The prose
‚writer chooses the most obvious, the
2poct very likely the least obvious.

ιο. vitem, ἀπὸ κοινοῦ, with ‘ premant '
and ⁸ dedit.'

et. Some good MSS. (including B)
have ‘ ut,' which also stands in the
'lemma of Porph. Ifwe read ‘ ut ’ there

toils that other men may drink os his
wine, as well as against the trader who
risks his lise sor his gold cups and rare
wines. The irony would be not un-
likely to attract5an emendator, but it
seems beyond the requirements of this
place. We want the ‘exsiccet‚' ‘let
him drain,’ that Horace may acquiesce
in the good fortune of the trader, even
if he afterwards undervalues it.

11. exsiccet, ‘cum aliqua aviditatis
significatione,' Orell.

oulullis, A. P. 434, apparently used
for ‘large cups.’ According to the
Schol. they were originally ¹ calices
fictiles quibus pontifices virginesque
Vestales in sacris utebantur.'

12. Syra reparata merce, obtained
by bartering Syrianwares. The mean-
ing of ‘reparo ’ seems to be ‘to obtain
in exchange,’ the ‘ re ¹ playing the part
of ἀπὸ in ἀποδίδοσθαι, ‘to give for a
consideration) ἀπαιτεῖν, etc. Forcell.
quotes for the use two fragments of
Alfenus Varus and Scaevola *contained
in the Digest, ‘alios boves his numis
reparare,' ‘ messes reparare’ ς see on Od.
1. 37. ²4 ‘latentes Classe cita reparavit
oras! Bentley, denying this use of
‘ reparo,' alters that passage=and inter-
prets this, ‘ condita vel medicata Syriaco
nardo,' referring to the Roman practice
of mixing spices and persumes with cer-
tain wines. For the ‘ Syrian wares’ cp.
Od. 3. 29. 60 ‘Tyriae merces.’ These
would consist of the produce of the
East‚ amongst them of spices and per-
fumed oils. ‘Assyria nardo‚’ 2. 11. 16;
‘ Malobathro Syrio‚' 2. 7. 8.

the trader his wealth, and yet he surely,
if any one, must be a favourite (not,
like the Campanian vine-grower, of
Fortune, but) of the gods themselves,
