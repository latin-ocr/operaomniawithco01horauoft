ODE XI,

O' Manem and my lyre,·teach me some strain that will win the obdurate ear of
Lyde. She is like a young unbroken colt3 but music has made tigers and forest
trees and rivers stay to‘listen. ·1t has tamed Cerberus, and beguiled the pain of
Ixion and Tityus and the Danaids wich their leaking pitchers. Let Lyde hear
their tale—how they slew their husbands, all save one—their punishment, and
Hypermnestra’s undying glory. ’

Lyde is warned not ‘placito pugnare amori ¹ by the story of the Danaids and

⁴ their punishment, and the noble exception of Hypermnestra. The application of

the story is not very close. The form, of the Ode seems to be a nearer imitation
than usual of the construction of an Ode of Pindar3 the commencement by an
“ invocation of Mercury and the vlyre ; the accidental way in which, through the
recountal of the feats of music, the ‘Danaids are introduced; the myth told at
length, but lest to be applied by the reader’s wit. Compare 3. 3 and 3. ²7·

For the story of the Danaids read Aesch. Pr. V. 853-869 andsOv. Her. 14
‘ Hypermnestra Lynceo, ’ whichcontains frequent reminiscences and expressions of
passages in this Ode. Compare vv. 3, 4 ‘Clausa domo teneor gravibusque coer-
cita vinclis: Est mihi supplicii causa fuisse piam, ’etc. with vv. 45, 46 of the Ode,

ζ’ , vv. 35, 36 with 41 foll„ νν. 73, 74‘ Surge age, Belide, de tot modo fratribus unus;

Nox tibi, ni properas, ista perennis erit‚’ with vv. 37, 38, and vv.127—130 with
v. 51, see note.

Ritter suggests that the story would be especially ‘familiar to the Roman public

¹ 'at the time when Horace was writing these Odes, from the fact that a group of the

 

Danaids formed a chief feature in the portico of the temple of Apollo on the Pala-
tine, which Augustus dedicatedin 13.c. 28 (see Od. 1. 31). Prop. 3. 23. 4, Ov. A. A.
