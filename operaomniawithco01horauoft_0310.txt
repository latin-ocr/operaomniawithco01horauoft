H ORATI I CARMINUM

Dicit et centum potiore signis

Munere donat, · ιο
Flebili sponsae iuvenemve raptum ι
Plorat et vires animumque moresque
Aureos educit in astra nigroque

Invi-det Orco.
Multa Dircaeum levat aura cycnum, 25
Tendit, Antoni, quotiens in altos ⁸

Nubium tractus.

Ego apis Matinae

More modoque
Grata carpentis thyma per laborem
Plurimum circa nemus >uvidique 30
Tiburis ripas operosa parvus - ’

Carmina fingo.

ve varies the ‘ sive‚’ ‘ sive‚’ of the last
two stanzas, although he is adding a
fresh department of poetry, viz. the
θρῖἳνοι. Cp. 1. 22. 5-7 ‘sive . . sive . .

2 3. aureos is predicative, ‘ as all
golden‚' ‘ painted as golden ’ς cp. 1. 5. 9.
The double contrast of the bright stars
above, the gloomy shades (¹ all colours
are alike in the dark ⁵) below, is indicated
by the verb ¹ educit‚' on one side, by the
adjective ‘ nigro ¹ on the other.

educit, in astra, as ‘ Musa vetat
mori: Caelo Musa beat: 4. 8. 27, of
immortality in fame.

2 5. multa ama3 there is no sear of
his falling; the free and buoyant winds
of heaven are beneath him as he soars
into the upper air. Horace contrasts
Pindar’s higher flights and original in-
spiration with his own humble aims and
laborious imitative method, ‘ gathering
honey from flower to flower of Greek
lyrlcs, and enshrining it in the ‘⁶ cun'osa.
felicitas ’' of his own poetical style ’ς in
v. 29, ‘ circa nemus . . Tiburis,’ we get a
slightly different idea, ‘from wood to
wood of his Sabine neighbourhood? The
simile was introduced to⁴ express the

difference in genius and literary habits
between Pindar and Horaoe, but it sug- '
gests to the poet his own wanderings in
the valley os the Anio. The Matinian
bee (save in its antitype, the poet of
Venusia) has no business at Tibur. ’

Dircaeum3 Virg. E. 2. ²4 ‘ Amphion
Diroeeus’ = ‘ Theban ’; buta ‘ spring'will
be specially germane to a ‘ swan?

26. Antoni. -As Orelli points out,
the name is repeated to mark the sum-

28. more modoque, a common for-
mula. Cicero's ent, Timaeus, seu

do.’

30. plurimum, probably with ‘labo-
rem? and with a slight relation of anti-¹
thesis, as its position shows, to ‘ grate
Dinr„ aster Bentley, joins ‘plurimum
nemus '3 but the epithet would not be

very forcible (Bentley wished to escape γ
from it to ‘ floreum ’), and ‘nemin ripas- ἡ
que uvidi Tiburis ¹ is a thoroughly Hora· ·

tian arrangement.

uvidi3 1. 7. 14. 3. 29. 6.

31. operosa,parvus . . finan, prob-
ably not without some reference back to
the first descriptiones Pindar’s poeti-y,
its vast spontaneous rush, ‘immensus
ruit profundo ore.'
