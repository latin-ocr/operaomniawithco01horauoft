LIB. 1v. OD. 9. 295

- was sent by him to the East as the companion 'and adviser of his grandson Caius

Caesar in 1³.c. 2. The· issue of Lollius‘ campaign on the Rhine had not been un-
successfuh and it is likely enough that Horace would rush to the rescue of a fn'end

¹ of his own and of theremperor's, against whom, in the moment of what may have

seemed a single and undeserved failure, the world had begun to breathe graver
charges, possibly such as were subsequently shown to be true, but such as his

friends in Rome could still discredit.

NE sorte credas interitura, quae
Longe sonantem natus ad Aufidum
Non ante volgatas per artes
Verba loquor socianda chordis:
Non, si priores Maeonius tenet 5
Sedes Homerus, Pindaricae latent
Ceaeque et Alcaei minaces
Stesichorique graves Camenae3
Nec, si quid olim lusit Anacreon,
Delevit aetas ; spirat adhuc amor [ὀ

1. ne forte credas, not a direct

⁴ · prohibition, in which sense Horace

 

would rather say ‘ne credideris' (see
on 1.33. 1), but as in Epp. 1. 1.13(‘Ac
ne forte roges quo me duce quo lare
tuter: Nullius addictus iurare in verba
magistri Quo me cunque rapit tempestas
deferor hospes’; cp. Sat. 2. 1. 80). giving
the negative purpose of the following
statement. ¹ To prevent your fancying‚
as perhaps you might, that my poetry
will die. let me remind yo‘u of the same
of other lyric poets.’ The preamble
serves to connect the discourse on lyric
poetry with the stanzas about Lollius
personally. ‘Lest you should under-
value an Ode from me, I will proceed
‘⁶ pretium dicere muneri ’'.'

2. longe sonantem3 3. 30. 10 ‘qua
violens obstrepit Aufidus‚’ 4. 14. 2 5 foll„

, Sat. 1. 1. 58.

. 3. non ante volgatas per artes: the
plural, of the rules of an art. ‘ Volga-
tas‚' rather ‘ knowntdthebworldss in its
products, than ‘divulged ¹ as secrets to
a special artist ; but there is intended to
be a certain mystical air about the
words, a suggestion of the metaphor of
3. 1. 2, 3 ‘carmina non prius Audita
musarum sacerdos‚' etc. The words
qualify the whole clause ‘ quae natus ad
Aufidum . . verba loquor‚’ etc„ ‘verba
socianda ehordis' being merely a peri-

phrasis for lyrical poetry, and there
being the usual antithesis between his
birth—place and his claim. It is Latin
lyric poetry which he professes to have
invented, or populan'sed, as he puts it,
when he is speaking more responsibly
in Epp. 1.'19 ‘ Ostendi Latio . . volgavi.’

5. Maeonius 3 1. 6. 2, the adjectival
form of ⁸ Maeonides! Tradition was
divided on> the question whether Homer
was so called as literaUy a son os Maeon,
or only as a Lydian.

6. latent, are hidden from sight, for-
gotten.

7. Oeam 2. 1. 38, the Muse of Si-
monides.

Alcaei minaces, the poems in which
he attacked Myrsilus and other tyrants
of Mitylene. ‘ Pugnas et exactos tyran-
nos‚' 2. 13. 30-32.

8. Stesichori graves Camenae.
To us who do not possess his poems,
the epithet is best interpreted by Quintil.
10. r. 62 ‘Stesichorum quam sit ingenio
validus materiae quoque ostenderunt,
maxima bella et clarissimos canentem
duces et epici carminis onera lyra susti-
nentem. Reddit enim personis in agendo
simul loquendoque debitam dignitatem.'

9. lusit, as παίζειν, of- light and playful
poetry. It contrasts with the dignity
of Stesichorus and the passion of Sappho
see on 1. 32· 2. “
