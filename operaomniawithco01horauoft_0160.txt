1 1 8 ΗΟΚΑΤῙΙ CARMINUM

ODE ΙΙΙ.

‘Lu-r the thought of death moderate both repining in trouble and exultation in
prosperity. Enjoy yourself while you may, sor death is at hand, for rich and noble
as well as for poor and humbly born! ,

Some little doubt hangs over the name of the person to whom these counsels
of Epicureanism are addressed. The old Blandinian MS. gave it as ‘ Gellius?
Cruquius identifies him with L. Gellius Publicola, the brother (half brother
through their mother Polla or brother by adoption, according to different theories)

of Messalla (Od. 5. 21. 7), and consul ⁸..c 36.
Dellius (as the other good MSS. and the MSS. of Acr. and Porph. write the

name) would probably be Q. Dellius, who had changed sides so often that
Messalla is said to have nicknamed him· Desultor bellorum civilium! He had
deserted successively Dolabella, Cassius, and finally Antony on the eve of the

battle of Actium. Gellius’ character was not such that Horace would gain much ι

by the substitution of his name for that of Dellius.
