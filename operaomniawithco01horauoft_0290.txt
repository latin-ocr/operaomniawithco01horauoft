HORATII CARMINUM

Crede veloci, nisi herile* mavis
Carpere pensum,
Regius sanguis, dominaeque tra-di 65

Barbarae pellex.

Aderat querenti

Perfidum ridens Venus et remisso

Filius arcu.

Mox, ubi lusit satis: Abstineto,

Dixit, irarum calidaeque rixae, 70

Cum tibi invisus laceranda reddet
Cornua taurus.

Uxor invicti Iovis-esse nescis:

Mitte singultus, bene ferre magnam

Disce* fortunam; tua sectus orbis 75
Nomina ducet. ’

64. carpere pensum3 Prop. 4. 3. 15 «meaning, at Europa's misplaced

⁴ tristes sua pensa ministrae Carpebant,
medio nebat et ipsa loco,‘ of maidens
carding their ‘weighed portions' of wool
sor the mistress to spin.

65. sanguin 2. πο. 6, 4. 2. 13, C. S. ’

49ὲ6. barbarae, ‘foreign‚' as though a
Greek, and not a Tyrian, were talking.
Cp. Conington on Virg. Aen. 2. 504.
The ‘ pellex ' will be at the command of
the native queen, as Cassandra at Cly-
temnaestra's in the Agam.

67. perfidum ridens3 1. 22. 23, 2.
12. 14, 2. 19. 6. Her‘smile of trea-
chery’ is partly at the success of the
device which has beguiled Europa;
partly (the emphasis being rather on
‘ridens‚' which comes to some extent
παρὰ προσδοκίαν), with a more playful

which she is about to allay. Cupiffizsf’
his bow unstrung‚ to show that his
work is over. >

69. abstineto irarum3 see on 2. 9.
17.

71. cum, ‘ since! Venus repmts
Europa's words in vv. 45 foll.: ·You
shall see him who was the buu again.
and you shall have the power to te‘ar
his horns as you wished, if you still
desire it:

73. uxor esse neseis. Either the
Greek construction for ⁸ uxorem te esse.
nescis’; or, as Orelli prefers‚=‘tanquam “
uxorem te gerere nescis,' ‘ you know not
how to play the wife.’ ⁸

75. sectus orbis, ‘ half the world.''

76. nomina, plural, as 4. 2. 3 ‘da-
turus nomina ponto?
