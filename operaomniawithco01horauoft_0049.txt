ODES, BOOKS 1-111. 7

super urbe curas,' ‘ Tu civitatem quis deceat status Curas, et urbi

Sollicitus times.’ These expressions have been usually interpreted of
' the powers which Augustus is known to have delegated to Maecenas

during his own absence from Rome in the last year of the civil war.
Dio 51. 3, Tac. Ann. 6. 11 ‘Augustus bellis civilibus Cilnium Mae-
cenatem equestris ordinis cunctis apud Romam atque Italiam prae-

* posuit.’ If the later date of these Odes were adopted it would seem

necessary to assume, what is probable enough in itself, but not other-
wise ascertained, that the same powers were entrusted to Maecenas
during Augustus’ absence in Gaul and Spain in the years B.c. 27-2 4.

11.-THE ORDER OF THE oDES.

ξ 9. IN the preceding pages it has been assumed that the first three
Books of the* Odes were published together. This is not a necessary
inference from Suetonius’ words; all that we know from him being
that three Books had been published before the fourth was com-
menced. But if we may assume that the present division of Odes
between the Books is the original division, it will follow that the
publication of the three must have been simultaneous, not successive,

ἑ 'for, whatever be the principle of the arrangement of the Books, it

certainly is not chronological ¹. For this reason, then, if for no other,
it may be a matter of some interest to see the evidence in favour of

’ ξ the present order of the Odes.

§ 10. In the first place, it has at least the right of undisputed tradi-

ἵ “ tional possession. One MS. indeed, and that the important Berne MS„

ignores the division into Books, and to some extent rearranges the
Odes ; but we may notice (a) that the Fourth Book (which certainly
was separate), and even the Epodes, are treated in the same way as
the Odes of Books i-iii3 (b) that a purpose can be probably assigned

⁸ We have seen that 1. 24 dates from associated with 3. 1-6; 1. 26 ranges it-

» the same year as 3. 14; 1.12 seems to sels with 3. 8, and this again is certainly

be one of the latest, 3. 29 one of the prior to 1. πο.
