LIB. III. OD. 19. 223

ODE XIX.

⁸ Coma, Telephus, enough of your antiquarian lore; attend to the more practical
question where and when we are to sup this cold night! Then, with a sudden
change, he fancies the banquet already prepared (cp. 2. 7. 21 foll, α. 11. 18 foll.) :
‘We have to drink the new month, and our. friend Murena, the newly-elected
Augur. Strike up with pipe and harp ; no grudging, scatter the roses. Let morose
old Lycus hear our riot next door. and his ill-matched young wife. We are better
matched here, Telephus and Rhode, 1 and Glycera.'

Telephus is a mythological name which Horace used before in 1. 13 (see Introd.
to that Ode), and uses again in 4. 11. 21. It is of course possible that a real
person is intended in this ease, though it is hard t'o see why his name should
be concealed. Ritter hits upon the rhetorician Heliodorus, the companion of
Horace’s'journey to Brundisium (⁴ Graecorum longe doctissimus? Sat. 1. 5. 3), with
whose profession such antiquarian questions would suit, and whose name he fancies
to be etymologically played on in ⁴ Telephus ’ (τῆλε φάος).

Ι rFor Murena see on 2. 2. 5 and 2. 10 Introd.
