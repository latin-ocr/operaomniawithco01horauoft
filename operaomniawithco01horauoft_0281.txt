Pravi sunt elementa et tenerae nimis
Mentes asperioribus
Formandae studiis. Nescit equo rudis
Haerere ingenuus puer 55
,Venarique timet, ludere doctior,
Seu Graeco iubeas trocho
Seu malis vetita legibus alea,
Cum periura patris fides
Consortern socium fallat et hospitem 60
Indignoque pecuniam ι

here, as there, it is the desire of money:

54. rudis, withb‘nescit’; it is anti-

thetical to ‘ doctior '3 ‘ knows not, for he

⁷ has never been taught this lesson.’

57. Graeco. For the comparison of
true Roman sports to the more fashion-
able Greek ones cp. Sat. 2. 2. 9 foll.

‘leporem sectatus equove Lassus ab' in-
domito vel si Romana fatigat Militia
assuetum Graecari, seu pila velox. .Seu
te discus aget‚’ etc. The‘ trochus' was
a hoop; see Diet. Ant.

58. vetita legibus3 Ov. Tn'st. 2.

leve crimen avos' 3Cic. Phil. 2. 23 ‘Li—

59. eum..‚fa.11at seems to give the
reason of the foregoing facts. You
cannot wonder at it when the father
himself is engaged as he is.

periura fides: cp. 1. 18. 16 ‘ Arcani
fides prodiga.' You trust his honour,
you find it forswom.

60. consortem socium, ‘the partner
of his fortunes.’ ‘ Consors ’ was used
for a ‘ coheir, ' as ‘ sors ⁹ for ‘ patrimo-
nium, ’Fest. 5. v. It seems to be more
widely used for those whose fortune is
in the same bottom.

62. properet, trans. as ‘deproperaress
Od. 2. 7. ²4, ‘festinare‚' Epp. 1. 2. 61.

scilicet, ‘ this is the end of the whole
matter! The thirst for money, which
can never be satisfied, is the cause to
which Horace traces the cheating of the·
father and the gambling of the son, and
in it he returns to the lesson of the Ode,
of the first line as of the last.

improbae3 not to be confined to
⁸ crescunt‚' for it describes the nature of
wealth, which for ever grows, yet comes
no nearer to satisfy' ymg: it is like a
pitcher of the Danaids: τὸ μὲν’ ευ πράσσειν
ἀκόρεστον ἔφυ πᾶσι βροτοῖσιν.
