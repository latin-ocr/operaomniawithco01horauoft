OD. 1. , 265 ·

Duces thura} lyraeque et Berecyntiae

Delectabere tibiae

Mixtis carminibus non sine fistula;

Illic bis pueri die

Numen cum teneris virginibus tuum
Laudantes pede candido
In morem Salium ter quati-ent humum.
’ Me nec femina nec puer
Iam nec spes animi credula mutui, 30
Nec cer-tare iuvat mero,
Nec vincire novis tempora floribus. “
, Sed cur heu, Ligurine, cur
Manat rara meas lacrima per genas?
Cur facunda parum decoro 85
Inter verba cadit lingua silentio?

Nocturnis ego somniis

Iam captum teneo, iarn volucrem sequor
Te per gramina Martii q

22. It is difficult to be certain about
either the reading or the exact meaning.
A majority of the older MSS. have
‘lyrae,’ ‘tibiae,’ but the Bland. Vet. is
among those which read ‘lyra‚’ ‘ tibia?
In that case they are ablatives, construc-
ted probably with ‘ delectabere‚' though
they also may be taken aster ‘mixtis.’
Against the ablative‚ there is the unplea-
santness, to our ears at least, of four
verses out of five ending with along ‘a.‘
If we read ‘ ae,’ there is still a question
both of construction and sense. Are
‘ lyrae,’ ‘ tibiae* genitives after ‘ carmin-
ibus: ‘mingled strains of harp and flute';
or datives‚as Orelli thinks, after ‘ mixtis '?
And in this last case does ⁶ carminibus’
mean the joint strains mingled‚ as we
should rather say ‘of ' than ‘with’ the
harp and flute, or are ‘ carmina ’ the
voices of singers to be added to the

instrumental music? More probably,
perhaps, the former, as he is speaking
now of the music at a sacrifice (Od. 1.
56. 1); the hymns o'f praise are men-
tioned in the next line. For the ‘ lyra*
and ⁶ ‘tibia’ see on Od. 1. 1. 32, 1. 12. 1,
3. 4. 1, Epod. 9. 5. 6.
