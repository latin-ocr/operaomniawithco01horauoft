HORATII CARMINUM

Quam rem cunque ferox naxgibus aut equis
Miles te duce gesserit: ’ ’
Nos, Agrippa, neque haec dicere, nec gravem 5
Pelidae stomachum cedere nescii, ’
Nec cursus duplicis per mare Ulixei,
Nec saevam Pelopis domum
Conamur tenueslgrandia, dum pudor
Imbellisque lyrae Musa potens vetat ⁷ 10 -,
Laudes egregii Caesaris et tuas
Culpa deterere ingeni.
Quis Martem tunica tectum adamantina
Digne scripserit? aut pulvere Troico
Nigrum Merionen, aut ope* Palladis 15
Tydiden superis'‘ parem ?
Nos convivia, nos proelia virginum

Met. 7. 50 ‘matrum celebrabere turba.'
Ov. Her. 12. 161 ‘ Deseror coniuge‚’
may be explained perhaps as following
such analogies as ‘orb0r‚’ ‘viduor ¹.'
The alteration ‘ aliti ‘ is easy, too much so
to be probable. For ‘ ales ’ as the title of
a poet, cp. Od. 4. 2. 25 ‘ Dircaeum cyc-
num,' and the whole idea osOd. 2. 20.

3. quam rem cunque, ‘ every ex-
ploit which thy brave soldiery achieved
by sea or land, led on by thee'3 the
construction is as if the previous clause
had run ‘ scribentur fortitudo et victoriae
tuae! The tmesis is common in Horace,
cp. Od. 1. 7. 25, and even in prose, Cic.
pro Sest. 31 ‘quod iudicium cunque
subierat?

5. neque . . nec, ‘ we essay no more to
tell this tale than to tells etc.‚ cp. Od.
3. 5. 27.

6. stomachum. This rendering of
the Homeric μῆνιν ὀὐλομένην is quoted
by Charisius as an instance of inten-
tional ταπείνωσις, which he defines ⁶ rei
magnae humilis expositio‚' as if it were
an undignified word chosen to show
Horace's distaste for such a character.
In any case. in respect of this as well as
of ‘duplicis' and ‘saevam‚’ though the
traits themselves are traditional‚ their
selection is probably intended to point
a contrast with the milder themes which
Horace prefers ⁴ Ι cannot write of the

fierceness and the craft and the cruelty
of heroic wars.’

πλοῦς ἀνὴρ, Eur. Rhes. 193.

but Horace is probably alluding t‘o
Varius· tragedy ‘ Thyestes‚’ which was
brought out in the year aster the battle
of Actium. It was greatly admired.
‘ Varii Thyestes cuilibet Graecorum
comparari potest,' Quint. ιο. 1. 98.
