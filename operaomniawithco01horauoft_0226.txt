HORATII CARMINUM ,

Finire quaerentem labores
Pierio recreatis antro. 40
Vos' lene consilium et datis et dato

Gaudetis, almae.

Scimus, ut impios

Titanas immanemque turmam
Fulmine sustulerit caduco,
Qui' terram inertem, qui mare temperat* 4'5
ν Ventosum, et urbes regnaque tristia
Divosque mortalesque turbas

Cp. Epp. 1. 1. 5 of the retired gladiator,
‘latet abditus agro.' Orelli, following
B, has ‘addiditss which is used in the
same connection, as if it were the tech-
nical word, in Tac. Ann. 13. 31 ⁴ Colo-
niae Capua atque Nuceria additis veter-
anis firmatae sunt! Bentley supports
‘reddidit’ (which also has respectable

, MS. authority) by Tac. Ann. 1. 17 ‘prae-

torias cohortes quae post sedecim annos
penatibus suis reddidit? In point of
sense, ‘ abdidit’ or ‘ reddidit ’ are much
preferable to ‘addidit‚’ as helping the
general idea that the war is over. It is
the soldiers, not-the towns, that Horace
is thinking of. ‘ Addidit‘ views the
action from the side of the towns.

41. eonsilium. a trisyllable, the
penult. being lengthened before l, and
the semiconsonantal i=y. So in- 3. 6. 6
‘ Hinc omne principium? Cp. Virgil's
use of ‘tenuia,' G. 1. 397; ‘fluviorum‚’
ib. 482, etc.

dato gaudetis almae. They not
only give gentle counsels, but when they
have given them they rejoice to further
them; for in respect to them, as in all
other respects, they are ‘ almae? This
epithet stands last, as summing up the
benefioent character of the Muses, which
has been the. theme of the first half of
the Ode, and as leading us by the asso-
ciation of contrast to the impersonations
of brute and insensate force, whose vain
efforts and doom are the subject of the
latter half.

4²· scimus ut, ‘we all know how!
The preceding stanzan have been profes-
sedly addressed to the Muses. ‘Scimus’
reminds us that it is really a homily
addressed to Horace's contemporaries,
who had witnessed, so he hints, a repeti-
tion of the (1.1911101113611111. The same
comparison is hinted in Od. 2. 1².
0-10.

43. immanemque, the ‘ que ³ adding
only another designation of the same
object.

If we must go by a mere majority of
older MSS. we must read ⁶ turbam‘
here, and ‘ turmas' in v. 47.

44. caduco, καταιβάτης κεραυνός,
Aesch. P. V. 358. Here, as in 2. 13. 11,
the adjective has something οῖ’ that sense
of ‘ pronenoes to sall,’ which Bentley (ad ’

loc.) rightly holds to be proper to it. ,·

The bolt hung ready to fa112a touch
launched it. The adjective heightens
our feeling of the ωε with which the
Titans were swept away. Bentley con-
demns it here, as merely equivalent to

‘mdentel and would therefore alter it to -

corusco,’ which would hardly be an
ep ithet of sufficient point to ooeupy the
emphatic place. ·
45—48. The universality os Jove’s
rule is indicated not only by the nouns
‘fterram ‘mare‚ ’.etc which describe his
triple empire in earth, in> Hadae, in
heaven, but also by the triple contrast
of the ep ithets expressed or implied.

the* dullp earth’ (‘bruta,’ 1. 34. 9) and ’

the‘ sea stirred by every wind: ‘the
[busy] citios of the living and the sad
realm of the shades: ‘the [⁸ quieti or-
dines’ of the] gods and the turmoil of
morta] men.' However much they differ
in all else, they are all alike subject to
his sway. For Horaee's manner of
marking a contrast by giving an epi

to one only of the two things contras
see on 2. 3. 9, 3. 13. 7, 4. ⁴· 10. Note
also that the epithets actually given are ⁷
all such as imply some difficulty or un-
Iikelihood m the way of his rule. He
can sway the earth. however insensate
it be; the sm, however stormy ;the sad
shadow- world, as well as the world of
men; the turmoil of. earth, as well as
the quiet gods.
