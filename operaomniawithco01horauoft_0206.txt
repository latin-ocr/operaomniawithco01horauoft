164 HORATII‘ CARMINUM

O'DE XX.

⁸ Homer. will stay no longer on earth ; hewill mount into the clear air of heaven
and laugh at his detractorS. He whom the envious world despises‚ but whom
Maecenas loves, will not die the common death of men. Already he feels himself
changing to a swan. All the world shall see him and hear his music: funeral rites
have no meaning for him-⁹

Ι The Ode may be described as an amplification of Ennius’ epitaph on himself:

⁸ Nemo me lacrymis decoret, neque funera fletu
Faxit. Cur? volito vivus per ora virum?

Compare Virgil's imitation of the ‘same (G. 3. 8):

‘ Tentanda via est qua me quoque possim
Tollere humo victorque virum volitare per ora!

The Ode doubtless owes its place at the end of a Book to its general reference to
Horace and his lyric fame; but it does not look as if it had been written for such.

liquidum, ‘ clear,’ opposed to the
damp and heavy atmosphere of earth.
Cp. ‘ udam spernit humum,’ 3. 2. 24.

4. invidiaque maior, above the
range of envy. It is to attain this that
he will leave the throng of men. For
the use of ‘que’ after a negative clause
see on 1. 27. 16, 2. 12. 9.

5. urbes :the haunts of men.
