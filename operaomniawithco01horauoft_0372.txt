330 HORATII EPODON

EPODE II.

Honos gives a point to his praises of coentry lise by putting them into the
mouth of a money-lender notorious for his keenness in his trade. Cp. the saying
attributed apparently to the same person, the ¹ fenerator Alfius‚’ by Columella (1. 7)
‘ vel optima nomina non appellando fieri mala‚’ ⁸ that the best debtors become bad
ones if you let them alone.' There does not seem to be any attempt to make the
usurer speak in character through the poem; the pleasures named are those which
any Roman poet would have named, cp. Virg. G. 2. 493 soll„ Tibull. 1. 1 foll. It
is the irony of the conclusion which turns an Idyll into an Epode. Its point is
rather the strength of the ‘ ruling passion’ (cp. the ‘ mercator' of od. 1. 1. 16, who
in the storm ⁸ otium et oppidi Laudat rura sui: mox reficit rates Quassas ’) than, as
has been suggested, the elaborate hypocrisy of a money—lender who makes his
panegyric oua rustic life an excuse for pressing his debtors for repayment, while
he means all the while to put the money out to interest again at the next settle—
ment-day.

The diction of the Epode reminds us constantly of the Georgius.
