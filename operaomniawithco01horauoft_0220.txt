178 HORATII CARMINUM

Horrenda late nornen in ultimas

Extendat oras, qua· medius liquorv
Secernit Europen ab Afro,

Qua tumidus rigat arva Nilus,
Aurum irrepertum et sic melius situm, *-
Cum terra celat, spernere fortior , 50

Quam cogere humanos in usus .
-Omne sacrum rapiente dextra.
Quicunque mundo terminus obstitit,
Hunc tanget armis, visere gestiens,
Qua parte debacchentur ignes, 55

Qua 'nebulae pluviique rores.

Sed bellicosis fata Quiritibus
Hac lege dico, ne nimium pii

itolia . . Aurea nunc olim silvestribus
orrida dumis?

triumphatis, Virg. G. 3. 33 ‘ tri-
umphatas gentes‚' Aen. 6. 837.

possit, ‘be mighty to! Orelli quotes
Tibull. 1. 7. 3 ‘Aquitanas qui posset
fundere gentes.’ 1t exalts the greatness
of the seat. ,

44. 'fel-ox, as it were, ⁶ at the sword's
point’3 but the two epithets ‘ triumph-
atis,’ ‘ferox,' are antithetical, contrast-
ing the attitude of the two peoples,
Cp. ‘Latium ferox‚’ 1. 35. 10.

Medis, the peoples of the East, 2. 1.
31, but with special thought of the
Parthians ; see on 1. 2. 22.

45. late, with ‘ horrenda‚’ as ‘late
tyrannus‚‘ 3. 17. 9, ‘populum late regem‚'
Virg. Aen. 1. 21.

46. medius liquor, ‘the intervening
water‚' ‘venit medio vi pontus‚' Virg.

Aen. 3. 417; the Straits of Gibraltar -

are meant. They stand for the West
as the Nile for the East.

49-52. ‘Only the gold unfound, and
so the better placed, let her fortitude be
shown in spurning rather than in gather-
ing with a hand that snatches for mortal
uses all that is sacred? “

50. fortior=‘dum fortior sit.’ It is
a question whether this condition gram-
matically qualifies the ‘ extendat’ of the
, receding stanza, or the ‘ tanget' of the

ollowing one. It is bettfer, perha s, to
take it with the former, as thev atter
matches more closely with the condi-
tion laid down in v. 57 foll. ⁴ Let her
name be known in all shores from East

    
     
     
  
      
     
    
    

to West, only as the despiser of gold,
not as the greedy seareher for it. Let
her go to the world’s end, to the tropics
and the pole, only not to Troy! This<
stanza seems to confirm the view that

Horace, under the talk of Troy, is think- · , =
ing of real moral dangers os his country. ’

51. humanos in usus must be taken
with ‘rapiente,' as it is antithetical to
‘ sacrum,' ‘ cogere’ to ‘ spernere.'.

53—56. ‘ Whatever bounds have been
set to the world she shall reach them
with her arms, and rejoioe >to see with
her own'eyes in what quarter fiery heat
revels unchecked‚ in what uarter the
mists and dews of rain.¹ ’ he great,
majority of MSS. read ‘tanget' as ,
against the vulg. ‘ tangat'; and theme is
some force in Juno’s grudging assent

provided only as before that her condi·
tion is observed. ,
Ο(154. visere, of seeing as a sight. Cp.

. 2. 1 . .

55. desbgeohentur, see on ‘decemn-
tem,’ 1. 3. 13. For the description of
the torrid and frigid zones cp. ι. ²2.
17 foll„ and Virg. Gn. 234-236 ‘una <
corusco Semper sole >rubens et torrida ν,
{gligit 81ξέἕέιίῑῖιὲ uatr-ahffifflrm <gemla
glacie concretae atque imbribus atris!

57. bellicosis, ‘they will seek em-
pire by arms; the destiny which 1 have
announced is theirs on this condition?

58. pii . . fidentes, two motives may
induce them to forget her warning3
