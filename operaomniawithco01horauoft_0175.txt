LIB. II. OD. 9. 133

ODE IX.

‘Tan most continuom-mins, the longest winters, end at last. Let not your
grief for Mystes 'alone be unending‚ Valgius. Not even Nestor grieved inconsol-
ably sor the son of his old age, &nor his parents and sisters for the blooming
Troilus. ’Tis time to cease from wailings more womanly than theirs, and to sing
of Caesar's triumphs!

ΤῘιε Ode is addressed to C. Val 'us Rufus, a poet whose elegies are referred to
and quoted by Servius on Vlrg. E. 7. 22, and Σάι. 11. 457. The seattered and
doubtful hints which can be gleaned about him will be found in the Dict. Biog.
He stands in Sat. 1. 10. 82 with Varius, Maecenas, virgil, and the other select few

for whose literary approbation Horace cares. The Scholiasts speak of him as a
‘ Consularis,' and the name occurs in the Consular Fasti, ac. 12.

The date of the Ode has been a subject of controversy. Vv. 19, 20 can hardly be :-

unconnected with Virgil's lines, G. 3. 30 foll. :—
⁶ Addam urbes Asiae domitas pulsumque Niphaten,
Fidentemque fuga Parthum versisque sagittiS‚
Et duo rapta manu diverso ex hoste trdpaea,
Bisque triumphatas utroque ab litore gentes!

In both mses one set of interpreters see a reference to the year ιο. 20, when
Augustus was himself in Asia, and Tiberius, under his orders, advanced into
Armenia, and replaced Tigranes on the throne of that country, and alarmed
Phraates into restoring the prisoners and standards taken at Chartae. It is
impossible, however, in these poetical references to Augustus' exploits to dis-
entangle anticipation from history or the hyperbolical dress of historical fact.
Horace‘s language will be sufficiently accounted for by Virgil's, so that, if with
Heyne we think it unnecessary to imagine that Virgil inserted the lines in question
ten years after the composition of the Georgics and in the year before his death,
we shall think it equally unnecessary to set aside, for the sake of this Ode, Franke's
judgment‚ that the three Books were complete in n.c. 2 3. See Introd. to ,Books i-iii,
