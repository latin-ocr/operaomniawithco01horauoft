LIB. IV. OD. 8. 291

O D E VIII.

‘ Urmaiz other circumstances, Censorinus, 1 would send my friends bronzes and
pictures, and you should have the best of them. As it is 1 have none to give, and
you would not care for them. Verse you will value and verse 1 'can give3 and hear
now the value Ι set on the gift. Statues and inscriptions, the great feats of the
Punic wars, do not throw such lustre on generals like the Scipios, as do the verses
of Ennius. Would father Romulus have lived without a grateful posterity to tell
of him? Would Aeacus have won the happy islands but for Pindar's Muse ¹? The

Ἰ Muse gives immortality, and instals her favourites in a place in heaven, · witness

DONAREM pateras grataque commodus,
Censorine, meis aera sodalibus,
Donarem tripodas, praemia sortium
Graiorum, neque tu pessima munerum
Ferres, divite me seilicet artium, 5
Quas aut Parrhasius protulit aut Scopas,
1. donarem. This reference is to the 5.
custom of exchanging presents (‘strenae')
on certain occasions, such as the Calends

of March or the Saturnalia. Cp. the
Pseudo—Tibull. 3. 1. 1 ‘Martis Romani

ferres, ⁴ acciperes,’ sc. ‘ a me ; '
Od. 3. 16. 22, Sat. 2-1.12‚ Epp. 2. 2. 14.

scilicet emphasizes the condition, the
stubbornness of the ‘ if.' ‘ Au this would
happen supposing, you mark me, 1 were

festae venere Kalendae . . Et vaga nunc
certa discurrunt undique pompa Perque
vias urbis munera perque domos,’ and
read Stat. silv. 4. 9. The condition is
expressed partly' ιιι v. 5‘ divite me, ’etc,
the construction having been in the
meantime changed, so that the subject
of‘ donarem’ appears in the abl absol.;
partly in the words ‘grata commodus]
which answer to one another, ‘grata'
meaning ‘pleasing to their taste,¹ ‘com-
modus’ (cp. Epp 2. 1. 227, A. P. 257)

“consulting their taste.' ‘I would give

‚if I had them, and my fn'ends cared
for the1n.'

such passages as Hom. 11. 23· 259, 264,

to the use of a tripod as a prize at the
Pythian and other games3 Herod. 1. 144.

Virgils use, 'clipeum. .Didymaonis
artes,' Aen. 5. 359, which is after such
expressions as Soph. O. C. 472 κρατῆρες

,ἀνὸρός εὕχειροε τεχνή.

6. Parrhasius, a painter of Ephesus,
a contemporary of Zeuxis, and therefore
living about the time of the Peloponne-
sian war. Xenophon describes Socrates
as paying a visit to his studio. Quin-
tilian‘ (12. ιο. 5) calls him ‘legumlato-
rem' in the art of painting, and Pliny
(N. H. 35. 36) praises him as the first
who‘ symmetriam picturae dedit?

Scopas, of Paros, belongs to the first
half of the 4th century 13..,c being an
elder contemporary of Praxiteles, and
with him at the head of the ‘later Attie
school' of sculpture, which is distin-
guished from the earlier school, of which
Phidias was the representative.
