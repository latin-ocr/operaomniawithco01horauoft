70 HORATH CARMINUM

Caucasum vel quae loca fabulosus
Lambit Hydaspes.
Namque me silva lupus in S bina,
Dum meam canto Lalagen et ult ιο
Terminum curis vagor esspssditis,
Fugit inermem,
Quale portentum neque militaris
Daunias.1atis alit aesculetis»,

7. fabulosus, with its storied dan-
ers, the stories that would be told of
ndia as of any unknown southern

country, of its jungles, its strange

beasts. The Hydaspes is a river of the

Punjaub, the modern Jelum‚ Virg. G.
. 211.

4 8. lambit, used of the gentle wash of

water, as of fire, S. 1. 5. 73, Virg. Aen.

2. 683, etc. '

9. namque. The whole force of

ι ι, χ. the Ode is thrown on Horace’s miracu-

«Γ» ³ lous escape, which is the sufficient justi-
se* Ι fication both of the general statement
ν in the two preceding stanzas of the

safety of innocence, and of the parti-

cular statement in the two that follow
of the poet’s own indifferenee to out-
ward circumstances, see Introd. to

1. 34.

10. ultra terminum, beyond the
bounds of his own farm. A few acres

of the forest belonged to him, Od. 3. 16.
‚ 2 , S. 2. 6. 3.

911. expeditis, as Catull. 31. 7 ‘O
quid solutis est beatius curis'? a varia-
tion of the more usual ‘ expedire, sol·
5 vere animum curis? Bentley (and
Keller follows him) adopts ‘expeditus'
from some MSS. of less weight. Dillr.
supports the ablative on the ground
that Horace inclines to ὁμοιοτέλευτα
in Sapphic verses. Macleane points out
that there are six other instances in
this Ode, vv. 3, 9, 14, 17, 18, 22.

13. portentum, se. the wolf, τέραα,
*eampum not that to see a wolf there
was such a wonder, but he means to
ex'pressthe shoek which the sight gave

him, and half playfully turns the wolf
into a monster.

milita-rie, ⁸ the land of soldiers,' is
chiefly a complimentary epithet to the

poet’s birth-place, cp. 3. 5. 9 ‘ sub rege
Medo Marsus et Apulus’; 2. 1. 34
‘Dauniae caedes! All other -Roman
excellences are in the same way attri-
buted to the Apulians, industry and
hardness to the men, housewifely virtues
to the women, Od. 3. 16. 26, Epod.
A comparison, however, of
1. 17. 9 (see note there) suggests that=
there is some connection of thought
between the sive of the wolves and
the soldierly character of the inhabit-

14. Daunias, Apulia, so called, ac·
cording to Festus, from Daunus, an
Illyrian prince who settled in it and
became the son-in—law of Diomede, see
on Od. 3. 30. 11. ‘Daunias' isaGreek
form, not found elsewhere in Horace,
but not uncommon in Ovid; ep. ‘ Ambra-
cias terra: Her. ¹3· 164, etc„ though
more usually with Greek names and in
an adjective. The MSS. vary between
‘Daunias' and ‘ Daunia‚’ the latter
altered, metri gratia, in a few to ‘ Dau-
nia in.' For Apulian wolves, cp. Od. 1.
15. Iubae tenus. Augustus restored
to the younger Juba, in mc. 30, the king·
dom of Numidia, which had been for-
feited by his father, the elder Juba, who -

fought at Thapsus on the side of Scipio Δ ⁴

and Cato, and slew himself aster their
defeat. In mc. 25 Juba surrendered

Numidia, which beoeme a Roman pro- ¹

vince, and received instead of it Mame-
tauia with some tribes of the Gaetuli to

the south of it. As ⁵ Gaetulus’ is a eom- ,

mon epithet of lions (see on the next
Ode, v. 10), it has been supposed that
this is a passing allusion to this ex-
change, and that ⁴ Juba's new territory '
gives a date to the Ode. -
