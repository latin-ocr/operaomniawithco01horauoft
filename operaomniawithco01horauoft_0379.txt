LIBER. EPOD. 4. 337

⁴ mention of the fickleness and treachery of Menas, has been thought to fix the date
of the Epode, if it refers to him, to the period between his first desertion of Sextus
Pompeius and his return to his service in 36. Yet during that time he was serving
with the fleet which he had carried over to Octavianus' side; and, though he may
have visited Rome, he can hardly have become as familiar a sight to the Roman
populace as is implied by vv. 11-16. The office of ‘ tn'bunus militum ’ seems also
a strange one to be selected (Horace would choose the highest that he filled) for the
commander of a fleet. Several MSS, including B and A, head the Epode with the
words ‘ Ad Sextum Menam libertinum. Vedium Rufum ex servitute miratur usur·
passe equestrem dignitatern usque ad tribunatum militum,' with no sign that the
two inscriptions are inconsistent or alternative; a common mistake, which seems to
lead us back to some common authority of greater antiquity. Of the two names
offered, Menas was a likely guess to any one who knew the history of the time, and
therefore carries with it less probability than the entirely unknown name of Vedius
Rufus, to which there was nothing in the text or in the generally known histories
to lead a copyist or annotator. Orelli shows from an inscription that Rufus is
found among the cognomina of the Vedii.
