Tu, cum parentis regna per arduum
Cohors Gigantum scanderet* impia,
Rhoetum retorsisti leonis
Unguibus horribilique mala3
Quamquam choreis aptior et 'iocis 25
Ludoque dictus non' sat idoneus
Pugnae ferebaris: sed idem ’
Pacis eras mediusque belli.
Te vidit insons ‘Cerberus aureo
Cornu decorum, leniter atterens 32>
Caudam‚ et recedentis trilingui
Ore pedes tetigitque crura.

2'3. Rhoetum, 3. 4. 55. Nauck thinks
that Rhoetus owes his selection to the
assonance ‘ Rhoetum retorsisti.’

leonis, actually in the form of a lion.
See Hom. Hymn. 6. 44, Eur. Bacch.
1019 φάνηθι . . πυρφλέγων ὁρᾶσθαι λέων.

2 5. quamquam, qualifying what pre-
cedes, ‘ and yet.'
sative to this eoncession.

28. mediusque. The ⁸ que ⁸ mis-
placed, as in ν. 3²³ see on 1. 30. 6. It
is a question whether ‘ idem' or ‘ medius ’
is the main predicate. In the former
case the verse will mean, ‘Thou wast
the same (i. e. equally vigorous and suc-
cessful) in the midst of peace and in the
midst of war.’ In the latter we must
interpret with Orelli, ‘medius’=‘ mid-
way between peace and war‚' meaning
⁴ equally adapted for peace and war!
No real parallel has been quoted for the
expression: -the sense is the same as

‘ Sed’ is again adver- ·

Virgil's ‘ pacisque bonas bellique minis-
tras,' Aen. 11. 658, quoted by Orelli.

29. insons, without attempting to ·

harm you.

aureo cornu, as Bacchus is repre-
sented on the stage, Eur. Bacch. 920-
922. Cp. ib. 100.

30. atterens, wagging his tail, mov-
ing it from side to side on the ground—

σαίνων-ἰη pleased recognition at Bac· '

chus' approach; or=‘ atterens tibi,' of
a dog rubbing itself against a master or
friend.
Virgil’s ‘ caudamque remulcens subiecit
pavitantem utero' (Aen. 11. 812) of a
wolf slinking away in terror.

31. trilingui ore, probably the tong'ue
of each of his three mouths, as Virgil's
‘latratu trifauci? Aen. 6. 41 7. See on 2.
13. 33. For the intentional dullness of
this stanza see Introd. and cp. the end

of 3. 5.
