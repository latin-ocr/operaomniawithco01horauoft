HORATII CARMINUM

Tradidit fessis leviora tolli
Pergama Grais.
N eseias, an te generum beati'
Phyllidis flavae decorent parentes:
Regium certe genus et penates 15
Maeret iniquos ¹
Crede non illam tibi de scelesta
Plebe dilectam, neque sic fidelem,
Sic lucro aversam potuisse nasci
Matre pudenda. , 20
Brachia et voltum teretesque suras
Integer laudo ; fuge suspicari,
Cuius octavum trepidavit aetas
Claudere lustrum.

but the constr. which attributes the
action more personally to Hector is
intentionally chosen‚ as though by his
death he was the very traitor who
opened the walls of Troy to the foe.
Cp. Virg. Aen. 4. 17 ‘ Postquam primus
amor deceptam morte fefellit!

11. leviora, perhaps with a remem-
brance of Hom. 11. 22. 287 καί κεν ἐλα-
φρότερος πόλεμος Τρώεσσι ’γένοιτο Σεΐο
καταφθιμένοιο; but ⁶ leviora’ and ‘ tolli '
pffbably match and make one meta-
p or.

fessis, ‘ even in their weariness‚· Virg.
Aen. 2. 108 foll. The dative goes
grammatically either with ‘ tradidit ’ or
with ‘leviora t011i‚' in feeling with the
latter; for the constr. ⁴ leviora tolli: see
App. 2, 5 2.

13. nescias, an, an extension of the
common ‘nescio an,' which means ‘I
am not sure, but nearly so.’ It may be
either potential, ‘ Possibly you m'ay be
able to say, nescio an,’ i. e. ‘Possibly
though you know it not, aubum Phyllis
has parents among the great, a wreath
of glory to you their son—in-law,' or
permissive, ‘ You may say, nescio an,'

i. e. ⁶ You may be, pretty sure,’ etc.

'15. regium genus, after ‘ maeret?
‘ Her tears are surely sor some* royal,
ancestry and the unkindness of ,her
home godS,’ who suffered her to sall in
the world.

17. de plebe, a tertiary predicate
with ‘ dilectam! ‘ Believe that in her
thou hast not loved one from the rabble
crowd! Bentley interprets ‘dilectam’

as=‘ selectam.' It is true that here, as -

often, though not always, ¹ diligere'
retains its force of ‘ to love pre-emi-
nently,' ‘ to choose for love’; ⁴ dilectam ·

Cypron,’ ‘Cyprus of thy choioe'; comj -

pare Od. 2. 5. 17. .
21. teretem ‘ well-turned: ‘shapely.' ⁴

tieth year ended on Dec. 8, nc. 25.
The ‘ lustrum' was properly the saeri-
fiee performed by the censor after com-
pleting the quinquennia] densus

Horace recalls, but avoids the tech· ἓ
nical phrase ‘ condere lustrum! Liv. ι. ”
