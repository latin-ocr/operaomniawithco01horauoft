HORATII CARMINUM

Cum semel occideris et de te splendida Minos

Fecerit arbitria,

Non, Torquate, genus, non te facundia, non te

Restituet pietas ;

Insernis neque enim tenebris Diana pudicum ²5
Liberat Hippolytum,
Nec Lethaea valet Theseus abrumpere caro

Vincula Pirithoo.

21. splendida. The magnificence,
stateliness‚ of Minos’ court is transferred
to the decrees he passes. Homer de-
scribes him Od. 11. 568 Διὸε ἀγλαὸν
υἱὸν Χρύσεον σκῆπτρον ἔχοντα θεμιστεύ-
οντα νέκυσσιν.

23. Torquate. The personal ad-
dress implies that Torquatus possesses
the gifts of which Horace speaks. With
‘ facundia’ Orelli compares the hint in
Epp. 1. 5. 9, ‘Moschi causam,’ that
Torquatus was a forensic orator.

25-2 8. Two instances from mythology
of the irrevocable nature of death. The
emphatic words are ‘pudicum‘ and
⁸ car0‚’ and there is a certain antithesis
between the two stories. Hippolytus,

innocent and the victim of his chastity‚-
yet Diana, the goddess of chastity, could
not save him; Pirithous the guilty one
os the pair⁴ (see 3. 4. 79),—Th<·‚seus’
love made him share Pirithous' enter·
prise, and for a time he shared his
punishment; but when he was set free
himself by Hercules, all his love could
not free Pirithous also. In the story of
Hippolytus as told by Virg. Aen. ¹7.
765 foll. and Ov. Met. 15. 479 foll„
Diana's efforts are successful, for he is
the person whom Aesculapius recalled '
to 1ise3 but this is unknown to the
Greek legend as it appears in Eurip-
idlels’ Hippolytus which Horace here
fo ows.
