Prudens futuri temporis exitum

Caliginosa nocte premit deus

Ridetque‚ si mortalis ultra

Fas trepidat.

Cum pace delabentis Etruscum

Stirpesque raptas et pecus et domus
Volventis una non sine montium

Clamore vicinaeque silvae,

3. 10. 1, 4. 15. 24), and the reference is
probably to the ’part taken by them in
the quarrels of Phraates and Tiridates
(see Introd. to 1. 26). Bentley asks
how the ‘ quarrels on the Tanais ’ could
harm Rome. But, as with Virgil’s
‘infidos agitans discordia fratres‚’ G. 2.
496, Horace is only colouring by a par-
ticular reference the general ⁶ politics of
the East, and their possible effects on
Rome.’ In 3. 8. 19 he uses these quar-
rels as a*‘g*‘r‘61ffl''bf reassurance for
Maecenas, ‘ Medus infestus sibi luctuosis
Dissidet armis,' and Mitsch. thinks that
⁸ the ‘discors' standing in the place of
emphasis, may have this force here,
⁴ Fear them not, for they are quarrelling
among themselves! Bentley himself
wishes to substitute ⁶ dissors,’ to which
he gives the rather far-fetched sense of
‘ neque ad Europam nec ad Asiam per-
tinens, inter utramque medius, et quasi
extra sortem positus!

33. componere aequus == ‘aequo ani-
mo ordinare.’ The editors quote from
Suidas the words of Cratinus: ἄνδρας
σοφοὺς ἐχρῆν τὸ παρὸν πρᾶγμα εἷς δῦναμιν
‘ Componere,’ however,
has more distinctly the idea of ‘ reducing
to order ’ (as in ‘ componere lites: and in
less matters ‘ componere togam ’); it has
reference to vthe coming metaphors.
‘The present, if you yourself are equa-
ble, may be kept in some order: the
future is like a rushing river,—it may

be calm in its strength: it may be
flooded and carrying everything before
it! The vagueness of ‘ quod adest ' and
‘ cetera.’ suggests that they include near-

ness and farness of place as well as time, ·

and so form something of a link between
vv. 25-28 and what follows. ⁶ You,

.Maecenas‚ are scheming about the dis-

tant and the future3 but the present in
all senses is all that we can control?

34. alveo. Some good MSS. have
‘ aequore,' which Orelli adopts as the
less common word, and the less likely
therefore to ha⁸ve been substituted by a

aequor' are used of the surface 'of the
Tiber. But there they distinetly mean

the ‘level surface'3 here this. meaning
is barred by the epithet ‘ medio.’
