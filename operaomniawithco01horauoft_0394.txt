HORATII EPODON

Minatus Urbi vincla, quae detraxerat ἦ
Servis amicus perfidis. ιο
Romanus, eheu,—posteri negabitis-
Emancipatus feminae ,
Fert vallum et arma miles et spadonibus
Servire rugosis potest,
Interque signa turpe militaria ¹5
Sol adspicit conopium.
Ad hunc frementes verterunt bis mille *equos
Galli, canentes Caesarem, ,

10. servis, ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with ‘detrax-
erat' and ‘amicus,' see on Od. 1. 3. 6.
11. posteri negabitis, Cp. od. 2. 19.
1 ι ‘ credite, posteri‚’ of somethin g strange.

12. emancipatus, ‘sold as a slave!
Cic. Phil. 2. 21 ‘venditum atque eman-
* cipatum tribunatum,’ Plaut. Bacch. 1. 1.
59 ‘Nunc mulier tibi me emaneipo;
tuus sum, tibi operam do.¹ ‘Emanci-
pare’ abs. is ‘to free from “manci-
pium‚” 'with a dat. it came to mean ‘to
transfer from one “mancipium” to
another: ‘to sell.'

13. fertvauum et arma, i e ‘is a
Roman soldier still ιιι discipline and en·
dumnce! Compare Cicero’ s account of
what a soldier carried on his march,
Tuse. 2. 16 Militiae nostri exercitus qui
labor et quantus agminis, ferre plus di-
midiati mensis cibaria, ferre si quid ad
usum velint, ferre vallum! Nam scutum,
galeam, gladium, in onere nostri milites
non plus numerant quam humeros la-
certos, manus; arma enim membra mi-
litis esse dicunt? ‘'Vallus is a stake
sor palisading.

et. spadonibus, see on Od. 1. 37. 9.
‘ Et‘ from the context acquires the force
of ‘et tamen?

14. potest, in the sense of τλῆναι,
see on Od. 3. 11. 31.

16. sol adspicit, a trope common to
all nations, ‘before all Israel and before
the sun.

conopium a gauze curtain or tent to
keep off mosquit oes. ΤΙιε Romans de-
spised it as a sign of effeminacy; see
Paley on Prop 4. 11. 45 ‘Foedaque
Tarpeio conopia tendere saxo! Pro-
bably there is a special emphasis of
scorn on the foreign name as in Ju-
venal' s ‘Rusticus ille tuus sumit tre-
chedipna, Quirine, Et ceromatico fert
niceteria collo.'

17. ad hune fremente& ‘ chafing at
such a sight, ‘’hunc = ‘militem spa·
donibus servientem. ' Compare perhaps
the use of· hic' in Od. 3. 5. 37. .It has
also been taken (like ‘hostis’ and ‘ille’
’ἓωίἔὲεέἶζῑὲξ (ξεῖῗὲῗῖἒέι. {¹²33 5ἶέΐί
but who is sufficiently indioeted in the
foregoing verses. For the construction
we may perhapsk quote (with Bentley) ,
Epp.1.19.45‘ dhaec ego naribus uti
Formido: though it is a stronger sup-
port to his own reading‘ ad hoc! The
general meaning is well given by Porph.

‘[Gallorum] ideo mentio facta est ut
Romanos qui sub praepositis spadonibus
aequo animo militarent magis oneraret
{egigffffi‘g‘ssgoe‘jffl‘goffifflff
The sense is not altered, while the con-
struction is made simple by Bentley‘s
conjecture, ‘ad hoc‚’ or Fea's‘ at hoe}
adopted by Orelli and Dillr.; but the
MSS. give no encouragement to either.
‘Ad hunc’ is the reading which has the
best MS. authority (but gB omits most of
the Epode, and there is no testimony to
the reading of V), and it was interpreted
by Acron. The other mdings with re-
spectable authority are ‘adhue’ which
must be taken with ‘ frementes: ‘up till
this time neighing for the fi g3ht’ and‘ at
huc: which was read by gthe Comm.
Cruq., and interpreted by him ‘but to
our side'; cp ..Vell 2. 84 ‘Hinc ad
Antonium nemo; illinc ad Caesarem
quotidie aliquid transfugiebat? Neithet
seems to connect the lines with those
that precede as well as ‘ad hunc:

18. Galli.- These were Galatians,
who, with their prince Deiotarus, de·
serted to Octavius at the commeneement
of the battle of Aetium,P1ut. Ant. 63.

canentes Gaesarem, shouting hia
