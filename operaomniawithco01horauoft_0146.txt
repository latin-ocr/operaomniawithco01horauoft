104 HORATII CARMINUM

O D E XXXVI.

⁴ Tnms to the gods that have brought Numida safe home again, to the delight
of many friends, and of none more than his old schoolfellow Lamia. The day
must have a white stone to mark it. We will revel, we will dance: Bassus shall
rival Damalis in his draughts of wine to-day. Every eye will be on Damalis; but
Damalis will have no embraees for any one but Numida!

Nothing is known of Numida. Aer. and Porph. c‘all him ‘ Pomponius Numida‚'
the Comm. Cruq. ‘ Plotius? The latter is more likely to be right, as Numida is
a known cognomen of the Plautia or Plotia gens. It is usually supposed that
he was returning from the Cantabrian war, from which Augustus returned in
Rc. 25 (Od. 3. 14). Numida may of course conceivably have returned earlier.

For Lamia, see on Od. 1. 26.
For the subject of the Ode cp. 2. 7 on the return of Pompeius.

1. fidibus, of music at a sacrifice. Cp.
Od. 4. 1. 21.

2. placare, a general word for ‘to
secure the favour ’ of the gods, without
implying that they were angry before.
Cp. Od. 3. 23. 3.

debito, cp. in the parallel Ode 2. 7.
17 ‘ obligatam redde Iovi dapem‚’ ⁶ due‚'
whether it had been actually vowed or
not.

4. Hesperia, ‘the West.’ To the
Greeks It'aly was the ‘western land,'
and so we find the word used in virgil.
Horace himself uses it of Italy as com-
pared with Parthia, Od. 2. 1. 3²- In
Roman mouths generally it would mean
the countries still further west, and be
used of Spanish wars, etc.

8. non alio rege, see on Od. 4. 1. 4
‘sub regno Cinarae! The expression

seems partly to be due to the common
mode of computing dates, ‘ consule
Planco,‘ βασιλεύοντος Κύροῡ, etc„ partly
to contain a description of the imperious
character of the mle, there of a mistress,
here of a schoolmaster, like Horaoe’s
own ‘ plagosus Orbilius.’

10. Cressa nota. Bentley seems to
have been the first to suggest that by
‘ Cressa nota ' Horace meant ‘a mark of
Cretan stone‚’ i. e. of chalk. called ‘ creta:
or supposed to be called so, for the reason
