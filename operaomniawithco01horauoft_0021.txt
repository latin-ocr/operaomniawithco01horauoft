THE TEXT, MSS„ sCHOLrAsTs, EDITIONS..

 

AN editor whose knowledge of MSS. is almost entirely at
⁴ second-hand owes some apology, at least to himself, for dis-
’, cussing questions of text 3 but he can hardly avoid such discus‘sion.
7·- Even if he chooses an existing text as his guide throughout, he
Δ must by his choice virtually take a side in many intricate questions,
μ and he does so in the way wHich is the least instructive to his reader,
γ , by appearing to settle without discussion questions which are really
1 open. Happily the text of Horace is one in which, if some points
must always· remain in uncertainty, the uncertainty is of a very bear-
able kind. The worst result of a bad judgment will usually be only

’“ to prefer the least probable of two readings, either of which has much

γ to say for itself, makes good sense, and has been supported by great

’ scholars.

It will be seen that the MSS. of Horace, though very numerous,

are not very ancient. There are none, like the uncial MSS. of Virgil, -

οἷ’ palmary authority. There are a considerable number which are
, placed between the end of the 9th and roth centuries; only one now

² ss extant which belongs undoubtedly to the 9th. In addition to these,

we have the testimony of Cruquius (see below), at whatever value

³ it is to be rated‚ to the readings of a MS. probably some two
ι e· centuries earlier, and we have Scholia which are generally believed to
't , date, at least in their original form, from the 3rd to the 5th century.

Occasionally‚ where doubt hangs over the form of some salient
expression in Horace, we find light thrown upon it by more or less

’ -’,“ , certain imitations of it in Ovid, or in the later Roman poets. Lasdy,
