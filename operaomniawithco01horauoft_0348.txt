HORATII CARMINUM

Notis condita fastis κ , 15
Inclusit volucris dies.
Quo fugit venus, heu, quove color? decens
Quo motus? *quid habes illius, illius,
Quae spirabat amores, ’
Quae me surpuerat mihi, 20

Felix post Cinaram,

notaque et artium

Gratarum facies? Sed Cinarae breves
Annos fata'dederunt,
Servatura diu parem
Cornicis vetulae temporibus Lycen, 25
Possent utiuvenes visere fervidi
Multo non sine risu
Dilapsam in cineres facem.

rades just S. W. of Halicarnassus. It is
now called Stanchio‚ a corruption. it is
said, of ἐς τὰν Κῶ, as Stamboul of ἐι τὰν
πόλιν.

14. cari, ‘precious,’ ‘costly’; Ov. A.
A. 3. ¹29 ‘Vos quoque non caris aures
onerate lapillis.’ This is the reading of
V and of Aer„ who interprets ‘ gemma-
rum pretiis! Some good MSS. have ⁴ clari?

15. notis condita fastis inclusit.
The words convey a double notion: the
years which are gone are stored safely
where they cannot be got back again,

and where all can read the record of
their number.

fastis, the calendar.

18. illius, illius, of the Lyce I re·
member. Cp. the use of ‘Ligurinum'
111 4. 10. 5.

20. surpuerat, a colloquial synco-
pated form of ‘ surripuerat’: cp. Sat. 2. 3.
283, ⁴ surpite'; and see on Od. 1. 36. 8.

21. ‘Who reigned in Cinara’s stead,
a fair. sair face, queen of sweet arts.’
Conington. ‘ Felix ¹= μάκαιρα, ‘ quam ut
divam ac dominam suspiciebam.' For
Cinara see Appendix I. ⁴ Post Cinaram ’
may only mean ‘ after‚' in order of prece-
dence. as ¹ post Chloe'n‚' 3. 9. 6. Bentley
was the first to take ‘nota artium grata-
rum’ together, on the analogy of ‘ notus
in fratres animi paterni‚' 2. 2. 6. ‘et’
being: ⁵ etiam.’ It must be allowed

that the particle is hardly needed.. If
we separate ‘nota' from ‘artium,’ it
must be taken more closely with ‘felix
post Cinaram’; they will combine the '
‘Persarum rege beatior’ and ‘Romana
clarior Ilia' of 3. 9. 4, 8. In any case
‘felix' agrees with ‘quae‚' sc. ‘Lyee,'
not with ‘facies‚’ which is only substia
tuted for it in the last clause. Cp. Epod.
5. 73 ⁴ Vare . . O multa fleturum mput '
with ‘artium ·facies'; if it be so taken,
cp. 4. 1. 15 ‘ centum puer artium? 'Ibe
‘artes’ are well explained by the Comm-
Cruq.: ‘artium gratarum facies dicitur
quae oculis, nutu superciIioruxm cervicis
volubilitate, capitis gratia, totius deni·
que corporis motu placet.’

²4· parem, ‘to match the years· of
the crow ; ‘annosa cornix,' 3. -ι 7. 13.

26. fervidi, their hearts ‚still warin

with youth and passion, to heighten the .
contrast of the cold‚ burnt-out torah„ ’

that ean no longer kindle love.

28. dilapsam. This seems to have
been the reading of Acron, though the
MS. authority is rather in favour of
‘ delapsam ’ς the confusion is very com-
mon. As Bentley points out, the differ-
ence of the image is between a torch
burnt down to a heap of uglyv ashes
(⁶ consumpta in cinerem,’ Aen), and of
one ¹ tumbled in the ashes'3—what ashes
it is not quite clear.
