⁴ of ‘peperit ’—‘ sacerdos’ (=‘a vestal:

as in Virg. Aen. 1. 273 ‘ regina sacerdos

‘Troica,' as if it meant not merely

'⁴ ‘of Trojan blood‚’ but ⁵ a true Tro-
χ an!

’ J 33. Marti occupies the place of em-
phasis as stating in one word the con-
sideration which induces her to forego
the resentment which had such full

‘z Horace, Od. 2. 7. 3. Jt is here used in

⁶- the same sense as ‘ condonare' in Cae-

sar, Bell. Gall. 1. 21 ⁸ Dumnorigem Di-

.vitiaco fratri se condonare dicit: i.e.
Dumnorigi ignoscere propter fratrem.

illum ego, both emphatic. It would
not be strange that any other of the
gods ⁴should consent to the admission of

Romulus, nor that Juno should con-
sent to the admission of any but one of
that hateful parentage.

34. ducere, the variation of reading
between ‘ducere’ and ‘discere’ is as
old as the Pseudo-Aer. and Porph., the
former of whom interprets ‘ propinare—
p'otare,' the latter ‘assuescere sapori-

J omitting the Ode, and no testimony
τ’* xisting to the reading of V. ¹ ‘ Ducere'
is the simpler; it is a common Horatian
ord, as with ‘pocu1a,’ Od. 1. 17. 22,
Ξ Liberum,’ 4. 12. 14, etc.

12 35. adseribi ordinibus, ‘ascribere

how far any distinct metaphor is felt in
g ‘ ordinibus: whether a muster-roll, or the

seats of the Council-hall.

quietis, a touch of the Epicurean
doctrine of Sat. 1. 5. 101; cp. ‘ea cura
quietos sollicitat: Virg. Aen. 4. 379.

37. longus, saeviat, imply that the
sea which flows between thern must be
‘ dissociabilis.¹

38. exsules, the banished Trojans,
and provided they do not break their
banishment. ‘Dictum sane videtur
cum* leni quadam despicientia,' Orell.
The emphasis is really on the one thing
that she cares for, viz. that Troy and
Troy’s manners should have an end.
This is brought out equally by the half
contemptuous way in which she speaks
of the fate of the ‘exiles’ in compari-
son with that of their old home, and by
the grandeur of the destiny which she is
willing to allow them if this one pro-

* viso is attended to.

40. Priami . . busto. The Com-
mentators remind us that according to
virgil, Aen. 2. 567, Priam did not actu-
ally receive sepulture.

41. insultet, ἐπισκιρτᾶ, ἐπιθρώσκει.
A-lthough the word is used in its proper
sense, there is still a feeling of its
tropical sense ; t0'‘ leap upon ' a grave 1
being a mode of ‘insulting the memory
of its tenant, Hom. 11. 4. 177 τύμβῳ

pare with Juno’s words the actual de-
scription of the Troad in Lucan 9. 966

blem of Rome's eternity, 1. 37. 6, 3. 5.
12, 3. 30. 8.

to be opposed to the waste grass-grown
ruins ‘of Troy. Cp. Virg. 8. 348 ‘Ca-
