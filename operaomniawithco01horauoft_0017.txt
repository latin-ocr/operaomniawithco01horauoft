PREFACE. ix

⁶· · several unities. If my efforts teach a young reader
J that he has not read a poem properly unless he has

attempted to do this for himself, if they make him
less ready to admit in any poet, and especially in

‚⁷ Horace, the existence of ‘inert' epithets‚ and pur-
poseless digressions or amplifications, I shall not

complain that he should come to trust for the ex· ι
planation of his difficulties to his own imagination

>v rather than to mine.

Some> account of the materials at our disposal for
the settlement of the text of Horace, and of the prin-
’μ ciples on which I have endeavoured, where it was
necessary to do so, to exercise my own judgment‚
will be found in the General Introduction. In the
ι matter of orthography I have followed Orelli. ⁹
I have to acknowledge much kind help and many

ss useful hints from friends, especially from A. O.

Prickard, Esq., Foellow and Tutor of New College,

' who has been always ready with suggestive criticism,
‹ and to whom I was indebted for special assistance

in writing the notes on the Fourth Book of the Odes.
Ι owe also to his labour, as well as to the kind
courtesy of the Provost and Fellows of Queen's Col-
lege, the collation of the valuable Queen's College

’ MS. which appears in an Appendix to this volume.

WELLINGTON COLLEGE,
