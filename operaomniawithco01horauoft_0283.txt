LIB. III. OD. 25. 241

Dicam insigne recens adhuc
Indictum ore alio. Non secus in iugis
Exsornnis stupet Euias·
Hebrum prospiciens et nive candidam ιο
Thracen ac pede barbaro
Lustratam Rhodopen, ut mihi devio
Ripas et vacuum nemus
Mirari libet. O Naiadum potens
Baccharumque valentium 15
Proceras manibus vertere fraxinos,
Nil parvum aut humili modo,
Nil mortale loquar. Dulce periculum est,
Ο Lenaee, sequi deum
Δ Cingentem viridi tempora pampino. 20

followed by Meineke‚ Haupt, and Dillr.
11. pede barbaro. The point of
the epithets is the desolation or savagery
of the view; they correspond to the
‘ vacuum nemus‚' cf. v.· 1 3 : there is room
there for the god and for the museS. ε
12. ut, constr. after ⁵ non secus! i
Bentley, doubting the possibility of this
constr. and yet wishing to connect the
two sentences (others take ‘ut' as ex-
chmatory), would read with a few MSS. 3
⁸ ac ’3 but Horace uses ‘ ut ’ where ‘ac’ Ξ ξ
a

7. The subject of his song is to be
something notable, something new,
something which no tongue has sung
of before him. ’

s rgoens implies· that the events are
res .

8. non sacua, etc. As the Bacchante
who has been carn'ed by her srenzy to
the top of Haemus (cp. Lucan. 1. 673
‘vertice Pindi Edonis Ogygio decurrit
plena Lyaeo') gazes in rapt astonish-
ment on the plain of Thrace before her,
the Hebrus watering the middle of it,

Rhodope its western boundary‚—so the
' t. carried he knows not where
(⁶ devio '), looks with delighted wonder
on river-banks·and woodland. The two
points of comparison are the unexpected-
ness of the sight, and its effect in rous·
ing further the Bacchic or the poetic
ἐνθουσιασμός. Thrace is sacred land to
the Bacchante, the woods and streams
to the poet, 3. 4. 5 foll„ 4. 3. 10. ¹
9. exsomnis3 Soph. Ant. 1152 Θυί-
αισιν αἴ σε μαινᾷμεναι πάννυχοι χορεύουσι.
The epithet indicates her excitement.
Bentley, objecting that the Bacchae are
poken of- by Euripides (Bacch. 682)
d other poets as sleeping. and that
‘iugis’ requires an e ithet, needlessly
alters ‘ exsomnis ' to ⁴ Edonis: and he is

is more usual3 cp. 1. 16. 7, 9 ‘aeque τ
. . ut. ¹

14. Naiadum potens, 1. 3. 1.

15. valentium3 Eur. Bacch. 109,
1064, 1098. A comparison is evidently
intended between the supernatural
strength given to the Bacchantes by
the possession of the god and the power
to sing ⁸ nil parvum nil mortale) which
the same inspiration gives to the poet.

17. humili modo, ταπεινῶς. ‘ Mo-
dus ’ does not seem to have been actu-
ally used in a musical or poetical sense
in the singular.

18. mortale, ‘of mere man's utter-
ance,’ Conington.

20. tempora, the god’s own temples
as appears from 4. 8. 33 ‘ornatus viridi
tempora pampino Liber?
