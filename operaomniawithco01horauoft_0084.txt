42 HORATII CARMINUM

ODE XL'

‘ Do not go to the Astrologers, Leuconoe. Better b‘ear life as it comes; enjoy
the present, and think as little as possible about the future!

On the ‘mathematici’ see Dict. Ant. s. v. Astrologia ; ‘genus hominum potenti-
bus infidum sperantibus fallax quod in civitate nostra et vetabitur semper et
retinebitur: Tac. Hist. 1. 22. Horace himself was not above an interest in the
superstition of the day, see od. 2. 17, and Sat. 1. 6. 113.

The name of Leuconoe is chosen doubtless in part at least as a pretty sounding
name which suits the Choriambie metm, as Neobule and Liparaeus suit the
Ionic a minore of Od. 3. 12. It is possible also that Horace may have looked to
its etymology, but it is hard sor us to say whether it would have conveyed a com·
plimentary sense or the reverse; ‘candida’ or ‘clara mente' say some of his
editors, ⁶ empty-minded' say others. Pindar's λευκαὶ φρένες, Pyth. 4. 194, which is
quoted in support of the latter view, seems rather to imply ‘malignity' than
⁴ solly.'

TU ne quaesieris, scire nefas, quem mihi, quem tibi
Finem di dederint, Leuconoe, nec Babylonios

47. 11, ‘ catch them by the sleeve as
