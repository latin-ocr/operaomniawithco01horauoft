LIB. I. OD. 27. 79

O D E XXVII.

⁴ In Od. 1. 18 the poet had recommended moderation in the use oswine on moral
ἱ and religious grounds. Here his object is the same though the tone is lighter.
⁷ The Ode is a dramatic sketch of a banquet which is degenerating into a drunken

“ brawl. Horace interrupts it by an appeal, playful in its mixture of the Bacchic

’ , hierophant with the genia] poet of good living. The company would reply to
their monitor by filling his glass. ‘On one condition only,' he says, and diverts

. them at once from his own lecture and their rising quarrel to an absorbing interest
Ἰ ἢ in the love affairs of Megilla’s brother, his bashfulness, his imagined confidences,

his mysteriously hopeless fate.
It is at least an ingenious suggestion of Ritter's that the ‘Opuntiae frater

Megillae ' is the same as the Xanthias Phoceus of Od. 2. 4, whom Horace banters ³'

· on his love for a slave girl (the ‘Charybdis’ on this view of this Ode), neither

⁷ v Athen. x. p. 42⁷ Ἀ preserves part of a poem of Anacreon, which may have in-

⁴ spired the beginning of this Ode :—-

ἅγε δηῦτε (al. δεῦτε) μηκέθ’ οὕτω
πατάγου τε κάλαλητῷ

Σκυθικὴν πόσιν παρ’ οἴνῳ
μελετῶμεν ἀλλὰ καλοῖς
ὑποπίνοντες ἓν ὕμνοις.

NATIS in usum laetitiae scyphis
Pugnare Thracum est: tollite barbarum
Morem, verecundumque Bacchum
Sanguineis prohibete rixis!

, 1. natis. Horace* is fond of the deus‚’ the god who removes the re-
> trope,‘natamecu1ntesta,’ Od. 3. 21. 1; straints os bashfulness, Epod. 11. 13.

: ‘versus male nati: Epp. 2. 1. 2 33. Ritter thinks that there is an antithesis

2 scyphis pugnare3 cp. Juv. 5. 26 intended between ‘verecundum' (cp.
⁸- ‘Iurgia proludunt: sed mox et pocula ‘verecundus color,’ Epod. 17. 21) and

η 3. verecundum, ‘modici Liberi,’ is found in prose, as Cic. de Leg. Man.
