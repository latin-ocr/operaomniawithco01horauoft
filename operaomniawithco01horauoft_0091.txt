LlB. Ι. OD. 14. 49

O DE XIV.

, Tur, ship addressed has just escaped from a storm, its mast broken, its hull

shattered, its sails in ribands.' The harbour is in sight. The wind is rising again.
It is warned not to drift back into a sea in which it cannot live.

Quintilian (8. 6. 44) makes the Ode his illustration of the meaning of the term
‘allegoria’ ‘Ut ‘⁶ Ο navis referent,” etc.‚ totusque ille Horatii locus quo navem
pro republica, fluctuum tempestates pro bellis civilibus, portum pro pace atque
concordia dicit? And the poem of Alcaeus, which looks like its model, was
believed by the ancients to be an allegorical description of the political troubles of
Mit lene:—

Υ ἀσυνέτημι τῶνᾶνέμων στάσιν·
τὸ μὲν ’γὰρ ἔνθεν κῦμα κυλίνδεται,
τὸ δ’ ἔνθεν· ἄμμες δ’ ἂν τὸ μέσσον
νᾶΐ φοροῦμεθα σὺν μελαίνᾳ,
χειμῶνι μόχθεντεε μεγάλῳ μάλα· -
περ μὲν ’γὰρ ἄντλος ἷστοπέδαν ἔχει,
λαΐφοε δὲ πᾶν ζάδηλον ἤδη
καὶ Mimas: μέγαλαι κατ’ affro.
χόλαισι δ’ ἄγκυραι . . .
(Fr. 18 Bergk.)

As long as we are content with Quintilian’s general exposition, all is simple. The
allegory is satisfied when the commonwealthsin danger of relapsing into civil war,

ἡ has become a sea-wearied ship, drifting back into the storm. The masts, the sails,

the pine of Pontus, the Cyclades, belong to the ship, and we must not look for

ζ their exact counterparts in the State. Here, as with other allegories, we are beset

with difficulties the moment we attempt to fit the details more exactly. It has

' J been argued, from vv. 17, 18, that Horace speaks of the ship as if he had himself
‘ left it (but see notes on those verses), and that the subject of the. Ode must,

ξ’ therefore, be not the State but the Republican party. Why, others-ask, is it a
¹ Pontic pine, not some other—mean, perhaps, as more suitable to the mythical

origin of Rome? Acron suggested the answer, which has since been developed

” into a whole theory of the purpose of the Ode. Pompey was the conqueror of
4 Mithridatesvof Pontus. The ship, therefore, represents the fortunes of his son,

'- Sextus Pompeius, whom Horace would dissuade from embarking again in war

⁷ ' ‘with Octavianus after the treaty of Misenum, 13.c. 39.

The difficulties of interpretation seemed so great to Muretus, Dacier, and Bentley,

“ , that they refused to allow the Ode to be allegorical at all.

On our view there will be nothing to fix it to a definite date. The ship is in

³ sight of harbour. This distinguishes the Ode from Epodes vii. and xvi. (see the

Introductions to them). It is not yet moored beyond the reach of the wind. So
„ ⁷ long as the most timid politician could see in any movement a thought of renewed
t resistance to the rule which had saved Rome from anarchy, so long might Horace

 

ξ, have vented his fears, or appealed to the fears of others by this aUegory.
