LIBER TERTIUS„

ODE Ι.

⁸ Hm the teaching of the Muses, ye that are fit to receive it. All human
greatness is bounded. Kings are above us, bnt Jove is above kings; men may
differ in wealth and rank, but Death makes no distinction. To 'one who has the
sword of Damocles above his head no feasts will taste sweet, no music bring sleep;
yet sleep may be had in peasants’ cots or on a shady river bank. Moderate your
desires. It is not the desire for what is enough for life that puts the trader’s
happiness at the mercy of a stormy sea, or the sarmer's at the mercy of the weather.
The rich proprietor‚ weary of the sameness of the dry land„ builds houset out into
the sea ; but sear and conscience and care are not to be escaped; marbles and
purple and eostly wines can't take away a pang. Don't ask me, then, to change

my happy Sabine valley for a palace that will only bring on me envy, and wealth
that only increases trouble?

The exordium suits the beginning of a Book, and also indicates that the Ode or
Odes which follow have some special dignity. The sequence of six Odes in the

same metre, and dealing with the same general subject, is by itself sufficiently ν

different from the poet’s usual practice to attract remark. Diomedes,in his account
of Horace’s metres, treats them as one continuous poem, numbering Ode 7 as 23
and both MSS. and Scholiasts are inclined to preSS, beyond the bounds of proba·
bility, the connection between one Ode and another (see Introd. to Ode 3, and note
on 4. 1). The unity, however, of general purpose is obvious. The ends social,
moral, religious, political‚ which a good government would set before itself in
Rome are reviewed‚ and it is more than once promised that ,Caesar’s re'gime is to
compass them. The Odes fall by their subject, as well as by resemblances of
detail, into the same period as Odes 15, 16, 18 os Book ii, 'and Ode ²4 of this
Book.

The chief internal evidences ofndate are the references in Ode 6 to the still recent
Bellum Actiacum (vv. 13-16: cp. 4. 37, 38) and to Augustus' exercise of the censo-⁴
rian power (ac. 28: see Introd. to Od. 2. 15). The name of ‘Augustus' in 3. ιι,
if it is held to fix that Ode after January, nc. 27, when that title was conferred by

the senate on Octavianus, will still laeve it within the general period assigned to the
others.
