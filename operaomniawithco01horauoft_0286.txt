HORATII CARMINUM

Rava decurrens lupa Lanuvino,
Fetaque volpes.
‚Rumpat et serpens iter institutum, -5
Sffiffibliquum similis sagittae
Terruit mannos: ego cui timebo
Providus auspex,
Antequam stantes repetat paludes

Imbrium divina avis imminentum,

Oscinem corvum prece suscitabo
Solis ab ortu.

Sis licet felix, ubicunque mavis}

Et memor nostri, Galatea, vivas,

3. rava, ‘ravus ·color dicitur niger
mixtus cum fulvo,’ Aer. „

decurrens Lanuvino. Lanuvium,
now Civita Lavigna‚ was on a hill about
a mile to the right of the Via Appia (cp.
Cic. pro Mil. c. 10), by which Galatea is
starting, like Horace in Sat. 1 . 6, for Brun-
disium and the passage to Greece.

5. rumpat et. There is no incon-
sistency‚ as Bentley objects, between the
wishes of the first and second stanzas.
They are really altematives, though put,
after a common fashion, conjunctively‚
like the Homeric εἴθ’ ὄφελες ἄγονός τ’
ἔμεναι ἄγαμός τ’ ἀπολέσθαι; see on 3.
1 1. 49. ‘ Let evil omens attend the set-
ting forth, or stop the journey of the
wicked.' Both things may= happen to
thern, though not to the same people on
the same occasion. ‘L’ he continues,
⁵ if with my knowledge of augury Ι am
anxious for a friend, will at least do
my best to procure good >omens sor her.
Go, Galatea, where you like best, and
good omens go with you.' Keller and
Mr. Munro follow Bentley in adopting
the reading ‘rumpit.' which is found
in a few MSS. of value‚ and in the best
MSS. (not in the interpretation) of Aer.
and Porph. This alteration gives a
different colour to the whole passage.
All three stanzas will then, though under

ξ of the omens which stop, or ought to
{stop persons from setting out on a

f varied forms, be really direct statements

v journey. ‘Only those who think no-
{thing of religion would start in spite
of the hooting of an owl (the form is
optative or permissive, ‘ let the omen of
an owl‚ etc. go with the wicked’):
even if the journey is begun, it is
broken off if a snake darts across the

road: 1 shall pray, when Ι am anxious
for a friend's sasety‚ for the omen v01' a
croaking crow in the east, instead os
that of the raven flying away to the
pools.’ The transition from this to
stanza 4 is very awkward, unless, with
Bentley and Munroswe complete the

sense by adopting, in v. 15, the conjec- ν

ture of Lambinus, ‘ vetat'; so that will
mean, ‘in your case, Galatea, there are ’
none os these bad omens! The ‘que'
in v. 15 is awkward in that case, an
the direct enumeration of the emensa
must have owed its point, if it had anm-{g
to circumstances which we do not know?

7. eui timebo, ‘for one for whom ’ς
the dative has to do double duty. ‘ Cui’
is the reading of the Bland. Vet. and
the other best MSS: it was corrupted
to ‘ cur,’ and then to ‘ quid?

8. providus auspex. He will not⁴
only wait for the omens and judge them
when they come, but will look forward
to them, and try to procure good ones.

10. imbrium divina avis, as 3. 17.
12 ‘aquae augur annosa cornix,' of the
same bird. Both ‘ stantes paludes ' and
‘ vaga ' seem to refer to the same sign of
bad weather as that mentioned by Virg.
G. 1. 388 ‘Tum cornix plena pluviam
vocat improba voce Et sola m sicoe
secum spatiatur arena.' Horace will pray
that the omen* of good weather may
anticipate and prevent the omen of blad-

11. oscinem, ‘to give an omen hy
its voice‚' according to the division os
birds of omen given in Virg. Aen. 3. 361
‘ Et volucrum linguas et praepetis omina

ennae.²
p 13. lieet, sc. ⁸ per me,’ ‘I would not ,
hinder it! Δ
