LIB. III. OD. 12. 209

ODE XII.

THIS Ode seems to be rightly taken by⁴Orelli and Dillr. as a soliloquy put into
the mouth of Neobule. ‘ She is one of the unhappy maidens who can neither give
free play to their love nor forget it over the wine cup without the dread osan
uncle's fierce tongue. She cannot attend to her womanly work for the thought of
Hebrus’ beauty‚——Hebrus‚ as he comes fresh from his swim in the Tiber after his
moming’s exercise, for he is the best of riders, boxers, runners, huntsmen.'

The older theory made it all an address of the poet ‘to Neobule. But in his
mouth the contrast of the lot of men and women is not very graceful, nor the con-
nection between vv. 1-3 and the remainder of the Ode very clear, nor the recital of
Ritter, allowing the whole to be put
into Neobule's mouth, makes vv. 4— —12 the ‘patruae verbera linguae’ which she
imagines to herself. The uncle, however, would harldy spend the greater part of
his scolding' 1n praising her lover.

Gesner follows Acron in taking the whole as ironica1,‘Sotadico versu? The
idea seems to have arisen from an attempt to interpret the names, ‘ Hebrus '
‘ Liparaeus’ as ‘blear-eyed,'
‘ Vulcan-like.’ There are no other indications of such a meaning in the Ode.

The verse which Hephaestion quotes, to illustrate the Ionic metre, from the
beginning of a poem of Alcaeus, ἔμε δείλην ἔμε παισᾶν nano-raram πεδέχοισαν, reads
asif Alcaeus' Ode had been in some way the original of this one, and it favours
also the view that Neobule is speaking in this Ode of herself.

Perhaps it may be better mitigated by
observing that the contrast in Neobule’ s
mind' is not so much between one girl
and another as between the lot of
women and that of men. The latter

do either of these things or, if we do
them, to feel the terrors of an uncle’s
tongue. Cp. 3. 24. ‚24⁴ peccare nefas
aut pretium est mori.'

3. patruae, an uncle’s tongue' was
proverbial. Sat. 2. 3. 88⁴ ne sis pa-
truus mihi'; Cic. pro Cael. 11⁸ qui in
reliqua vita mitis esset. ‚fuit in hac
causa pertristis quidam patruus, censor,
