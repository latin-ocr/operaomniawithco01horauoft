·44 HORATII CARMINUM

Arte materna rapidos morantem
Fluminum lapsus celeresque ventos} ιο
Blandum et auritas fidibus canoris
Ducere quercus.
Quid prius dicam solitis parentis
Laudibus, qui res hominum ac deorum,
Qui mare ac terras variisque mundum ¹5
Temperat horis?
Unde nil maius generatur ipso,
Nec viget quidquam simile aut secundum:
Proximos illi tamen occupavit

Pallas honores.

Proeliis audax neque te silebo
Liber et saevis inimica Virgo

E 9. arte materna, Calliope's, Virg.

11. blandum ducere, App. 2. 5 2.

13. dicam, a usual word with Ho-
race sor ⁴ canere? ⁶ praedicare,’ cp. Od.
1. 17.19‚ 1. 19.12, 1. 21. 1, 3. 4. nete.

parentis, ¹ the sire‘ os gods and men.
This is the reading of the oldest MSS„
though both V and A have also a v. l.
‘parentum‚’ which is found in many
MSS. and was read by the Comm.
Cruq. ⁴ Parentum‘ might be construed
with ‘ laudibus ' as the genitive either of
the subject (as it is taken by Comm.
Cruq.), ‘the hymn of praise ascribed by
our fathers.’ or of the object, ⁶ the
praises ascribed to our fathers! In the
first case‚though the construction would
not run as smoothly as it does with
‘ parentis.' there would be no alteration
in the order of the thought. We should
still be answering the question, ‘ Quem
deum'? But the second rendering
makes ‘ Quid dieam’? not part of an
answer, but a new question: ‘What
can come before the praise of our fore-
sathers’? ‘ The praise of Jupiter.¹ We
do not expect to go through a list of
gods, and then to answer the question,
⁸ Quem heroa ' ⁸? before we come to any
further allusion to the ‘ parentes.' It is
not even as if the ‘laudes parentum'
were the main subject of the Ode,
worthy to be named now though they
are necessarily postponed for a time.
They are only to be parts of a climax

which leads up to Augustus. But the
idea that the purpose was simply ‘to
praise famous men and our fathers that
begat us’ would naturally suggest ‘ pa-
rentum’ to a copyist who did not read
on, or view the Ode as a whole. With
the ¹ Quid prius dicam ’‘1' cp. Virg. E. 3.-
60 ‘ Ab Iove principium, Musae,’ Theoc-
17. 1; and sor the whole order of the
objects os the poet's praises, cp. 4„ 15.
28-32 ‘ deos . . virtute functos due& . .
Progeniem Veneris.'

14. qui res, etc., Virg. Aen. 1. ²30
‘ O qui res hominumque deumque Aeter-
nis regis imperiis!

15. mundum, surrounding space.

sons’; so again A. P. 30² ‘sub verni
tempon's horam!
