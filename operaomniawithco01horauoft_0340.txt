HORATII CARMINUM

actually been consul 3-‘ not that· one year
only. but always.’ There is no difficulty,
so far, in the substantives, ‘ vindex‚'
‘consul,' as applied to ‘ animus‚' and
not to the man himself ; no more than in
the passage just quoted, where ‘ virtue ’
= ‘ the virtuous man‚’ is said to be always
consul. Bentley has collected a number
of similar instances from all Latinity;
‘animus lucis contemptor,' Virg. Aen.
9. 205, ⁶ animus liberator‚' ‘ carnifex,’
‘ proscriptor‚' etc. But the expression
becomes harsh and embarrassed when
the mind is said to be a ⁶ consul of more
than one year‚’ by virtue of its behaviour
as a Judge. Ritter thinks that this was
sostened by a consciousness in the poet
and his readers of the current etymology
of ⁴ consul ' as = ‘ qui bene consulit,’ Varr.
L. L. 5. 80. At any rate the harsh-
ness is softened by the distance of the
words from ‘ animus! With ⁴ consul ’
we take up the notion of Lollius, him-
self the eir-consul, and cease to feel

4o—44. sed quoties . . arma. ‘Sed
quoties‘ answering to ‘non unius anni,’
‘consul, not of one year, but in per·
petuity, so often as,’ etc., ‘quoties’ being
understood before the second and third
clauses. Orelli compares 3. 24. 40 foll.
where ‘ si‚' and 4. 8. 31 foll. where ‘sic,’
are similarly omitted. Of the Scholiasts
Porph. alone takes the stanza in a differ-
ent-way, making ‘explicuit . . victor ' the
apodosis to ‘quoties iudex . . praetulit . .

reiecit! ⁶ So often as on the judgmeut-
seat it resists the temptations of expe-
diency and bribery, it is a conqueror as
much as if it were scattering foemen in

real battle! The construction is not -

any easier, and the flow of the lines is
less easy, than if ‘ sed quoties’ gave at ‘
once the full antithesis to ‘non unius v
anni,' and started us on a fresli thought;
but Porph. seems to be followed, among
recent editors, if we may judge from their
punctuation, by Keller and Mr. Munro.
The question is partly mixed up with
the further doubt as to the reference of
the whole stanza. Porph.’s construction
is only admissible on the view (which
Orelli supports) that it refers entirely to
Lollius’ civil life, his conduct as a ⁴ iudex
selectus' (Sat. 1. 4. 133), the last two
lines being metaphorical. 1t must be
allowed, however, that under the cir-
cumstances of Lollius, and seeing how
lightly his military exploits would in
that case be passed over, it would be a
somewhat double-edged compliment to
speak of him as ‘a great conqueror-‚⁹
with the tacit addition of ‘metaphor-
ically and in a moral sense?

bearing in his province.
