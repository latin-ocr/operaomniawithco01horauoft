COMPLEMENTARY INFINITIVE. 379

‘interpellet durare‚' S. 1. 6. 128.
In the following instances the leading verb seems to be still more

¹ complete in itself, and the sense of ‘ purpose' (which in prose would

have been expressed by means of a gerundive or supine or final clause)
to be thrown more entirely upon the infinitive :—-
‘te persequor frangere,’ Od. 1. 23. 10.
’ pecus egit visere montes‚' Od. 1. 2. 8.
‘quem virum sumis celebrare,’ Od. 1. 123 (cp. ‘res gestas sumis
seribere,' Epp. 1. 3. 7).
‘tradam ventis portare,’ Od. 1. 26. 3 (cp. Virg. Aen. 1. 319 ‘ dede-
ratque comam diffundere ventis ').
‘ me expetit urere,’ Epod. 11. 5.

2 . Wz'llz A aJ'eclz'ves.

It is this use which, though by no means confined to Horace
among the poets (cp. Virg. E. 5. 1 ‘ boni inflare,' Aen. 6. 164 ‘ prae-
stantior ciere‚' eto), and not without precedent even in the best Latin
prose (for Cicero uses ‘ paratus ' (cp. Hor. Epod. 1. 3) with an infini-
tive), is yet sufficiently frequent with him to form a noticeable feature
of his style. The easiest cases are those of a participle (which passes
into a verbal adjective) from a simple verb which would require or
readily admit a complementary infinitive. Such are

‘sciens flectere,' Od. 3. 7. 25, compared with ‘nescius cedere,’ Od.
1. 6. 6.

‘metuens tangere,' Od. 3. 19. 16, with ‘timidus perire,' Od. 4. 9. 52 ;
cp. ‘ audax perpeti‚’ Od. 1. 3. 25.

‘doctus‚’ as a participle, Od. 3. 6. 27 (‘ institutus,’ Od. 3. 8. 11) ; as
an adj. in ‘ docta psallere,’ Od. 4. 13. 7, ‘ludere docti0r‚' Od. 3.
24. 56. Then we have ‘indoctus ferre‚' Od. 2. 6. 2, ‘indocilis
pati,’ Od. 1. 1. 18.

‘dignus’ (=‘qui meret ')‚ with an active infinitive, Epp. 1. 10. 48,
with a passive, Od. 3. 21. 6, Sat. 1. 3. 24, 1. 4. 3, 25, 1. 10. 72,
A. Ρ. 183, 283; ‘indigna,' A. P. 231.

‘ idoneus dare,’ Epp. 1. 16. 12. ‘ Fruges consumere nati’ (Epp. 1. 2)
is a step beyond this. ‘ Leviora tolli,' Od. 2. 4. 1 1, ancl ⁴ cereus
flecti‚’ A. P. 163, also belong here, the adjectives being only more
or less coloured forms of ‘facilis,’ and t'ne construction arising
from the conversion of the impersonal ‘facile est hunc flectere'
into a personal ‘hic facilis est flecti.’ We may add, perhaps,
‘vultus nimium lubricus aspici,’ Od. 1. 19. 8‚=‘quem lubricum

est aspicere.’
