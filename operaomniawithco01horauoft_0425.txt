INDEX OF METRES. 383

* are two other instances where a preposition at the beginning of a
composite word gives a quasi-caesura, 1. 16. 21 ‘Hostile aratrum
exercitus insolens,' 1. 37. 5 ‘Antehac nefas depromere Caecubum?
Horace seems to have paid great attention to the rhythm of verse β,
excluding‚ and more carefully in his later poems, all conjunctions of
words which did not by their accent counteract that natural sameness
of‘movement which we find undisguised in Alcaeus, λαῖφος δὲ πᾶν
ζάδηλον ἤδη, etc. No quadrisyllabic ending or beginning is found in
Book iv·except of the forms of ‘Nomen beati qui Deorum’ and
‘ Con'sulque non unius anni? Verses of the form of ‘ Gaudes, apricos
necte flores' (1. 26. 7) are· found only in 1. 16, 26, 29, 35, and 2. 1,
3, 13, 14, 19. ‘ Hunc Lesbio sacrare plectro ' in 1. 26. 11 is unique.
It was the occurrence of these two verses in 1. 26, and of the verse
‘ Alcaee plectro dura navis ' in 2. 13, that called Lachmann’s attention
to the wrong ,date assigned by Franke, on Justinus' authority, to the

⁴quarrel of Phraates and Tiridates, and consequently to these Odes,
which thu-s became specimens of Horace's later instead of his earlier

handiwork, see Introd. to Books i-iii‚ ξ 8.

There is no synaphea between the verses of the stanza, but Horace

’ . twice allows an elision of a hypermetric syllable at the end of the

third verse, 2. 3. 27 and 3. 29. 35. There is an analogous licence

taken in the Asclepiad metre in 4. 1235, and Virgil allows it in the ἦ

hexameter, Georg. 1. 295, etc.

ξ 3. The Sapphz‘c⁴ stanza is found in twenty-five Odes :-——
1. 2, 10, 12, 20, 22, 25, 30, 32, 383
2. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 16;
3. 8, 11, 14, 18, 20, 22, 27;
4. 2, 6, 113
and in the Carm. Sec.
It employs two kinds of verse, the lesser Sapphic, which is repeated

three times—

*,U*--'I-U ψ-Ιψ-Ξ,4

and the Adonic—

-υυ-Ξ.

The-materials of the rhythm in this are the same as in the Alcaic.
It is a sequence of trochees and dactyls. This is obscured in Horace,
(1) by his exeluding the trochee absolutely from the second place,
where it is often found in Sappho, and in her first Latin imitator,
Catullus, αῖ δέ μὴ φιλεῖ ταχέως φιλήσει, ‘ Pauca nuntiate meae puellae ' 3
(2) by his eschewing the break before the dactyl, φαίνεταί μοι κῆνος ἴσος
