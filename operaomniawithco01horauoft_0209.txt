for this would be to introduce a second
metaphor; but because it was to the

tomary at solemn rites‚ the first to warn
away improper hearers, ἔκαε ἔκαε ὅστις

2. non prius audita.. The initiated
are to *receive a new revelation. The
metaphor, if we are to interpret it, would
seem to include the two ideas, that the
Odes which follow are to be of a higher
mood than their predecessors‚ and that

3. Musarum sacerdos, a natural
description of a poet. Theoc. 16. 29
Μουσάων ἱεροὺς ὑποφῆταε, Virg. G. 2.
175 ⁶ Musae quarum sacra fero!

5. proprios, each over his own floek;
i. e. his sway is limited.

another, if he is a candidate for office,
can offer high birth; a third is a
“ novus homo,” but has higher personal
reputation; a fourth has a larger
number of clients on whose votes he
can reckon.' ,

9. est ut, ‘it may be that,’ as ‘ non
est ut‚’ Epp. 1. 12. 2. It is needless

coneessions are balanced in the apodosis
