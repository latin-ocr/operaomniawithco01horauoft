LIB. III.

OD. 16. - 217

Demersa exiti03 diffidit urbium

Portas vir Macedo et subruit aemulos

Reges muneribus3 munera navium 15
Saevos illaqueant duces.

Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam

Maiorumque fames.

Iure perhorrui

Late conspicuum tollere verticem,

Maecenas, equitum decus. 20
Quanto quisque sibi plura negaverit, ’
Ab dis plura feret: nil cupientium
Nudus castra peto et transfuga divitum

Partes linquere gestjo,
Contemptae dominus splendidior re'1‘, ²5
Quam si quidquid arat impiger Apulus

13. demersa, possibly, as the Schol.
thinks, an allusion to the legendary
form of Amphiaraus’ end—the earth
opened and swallowed him, Pind. Nem.
9. 25.

14. vir Macedo, a proverbial in-
Cp. Cic. ad Att.
1. 16 ‘Philippus omnia castella expug-

*nari posse dicebat in quas modo asellus

onustus auro posset ascendere) ·P1ut.
Vit. Aem. Paull. 12 ἐρρέθη γοῦν ὅτι τὰς
πόλει* αἱρεῖ τῶν Ἑλλήνων οὐ Φίλιπποι
ἀλλὰ τὰ Φιλίππου χρυσίον. He is said
(in the collection of proverbs of Dioge-
nianus) to have received an oracle from
the Pythia, ἀργυρέαιε λόγχωσι μάχου καὶ
πάντα κρατήσειε. So Juvenal, 1 2. 47, calls
him ⁸ callidus emptor Olynthi? and Val.
Max. 7. 2. 10 ⁴ Mercator Graeciae! The
‘urbes' are such as Olynthus, Pydna,
Potidaea, Amphipolis. In ‘ diffidit ’ and

‘ subruit ' (⁸ undermined’) we have a con· '
ἡ tinuance of the metaphors of the last

stanza.

14. aemulos reges, such as his rivals
for the throne, Pausanias and Argaeus;
the Thracian Cersobleptes, etc.

15. navium duces. Horace is gener-
ally supposed to be taking an instance
from contemporary history, and to aim
at Menas or Menodorus, the freedman
of Sextus Pompeius and chief captain of
his fleet, who twice deserted him to
serve under Octavius, and once deserted
Octavius to return to him. See Introd.
to Epod. 4, which has been taken by
some to refer to him. -

16. saevos illaqueant, - an intended

antithesis. ‘Illaqueare ' is found no-
where else till Prudentius (A.D. 3 50-400),
who uses it in its natural sense of snar-
ing birds.

17. crescentem, imit. by Juv. 14.
139 ‘ Crescit amor nummi quantum ipsa
pecunia crescit.' ⁴ ‘⁶ Cura,” ne perdan-
tur 3 “fames,'’ ut augeantur opes,' Dillr.

18. maiorum, neut. gen. μειζόνων.

12. conspicuum, ,prolept.=‘ita ut
conspicuum fiat.’

20. equitum docus, ‘the lesson
which you preach to us, Maecenas, by
being content to be the pride of the
equestrian order instead of accepting
any office which would qualify you to
become a senator,' see on 1. 20. 5.

23. nudus. Tojoin the army of the
‘nil cupientes’ he must be, like thern,
‘nudus’; he must strip himself of the
gifts of fortune which he no longer
wants, and be content with the cloak of
which he speaks in 3. 29. 54. The
metaphor of the camp hardly begins
till ‘ castra! Orelli points out that the
second clause, ⁴ transfuga . . gestio,' is an
amplification of the first, and one which
brings out more clearly, though it does
not create, the inexactness of the original
metaphor. To satisfy -it completely,
Horace must have been a rich man who
gave up his wealth. All he really
means is, that he would choose a
modest competence in preference to
great wealth.

2 5. contemptae, ‘which wealthier
men despise.’ ‘ Satis beatus unicis Sa-
binis.’ Bentley takes it as ⁸ contemptae
