HORATII CARMINUM

Audis quo strepitu ianua, quo nemus . 5
Inter pulchra satum tecta remugiat

Ventis, et positas ut glaciet nives

Ἶτο numine Iuppiter?

Ingratam Veneri pone superbiam,

Ne currente retro funis eat rota.

10

Non te Penelopen difficilem procis
Tyrrhenus genuit parens

O quamvis neque te munera nec preces

Nec tinctus viola pallor amantium

Nec vir Pieria pellice saucius

curvat, supplicibus tuis
Parcas, nec rigida· mollior aesculo
Nec Mauris animum mitior anguibus.

5. nemuS. This is usually taken of
the few trees which in a large house
were planted within the ‘peristylium' ς
see on Epp. 1. 10. 23 ‘inter varias nutri-
tur silva columnas! Ritter contends
that Lyce is not in the rank of life to
which such an appendage os a palaoe
would be appropriate, and takes it of
some public plantation, perhaps the
⁸ duo luci’ (Liv. 1. 8), between the two
tops of the Capitoline.

6. inter pulchra tecta, ‘Though we
are not, in the Scythian wilds, and
though you are comfortably lodged, yet
the wind howls outside as loudly and the
srost bites as keenly!

7. ventis. Bentley wished to alter
to ‘ sentis‚’ in order to avoid the double
ablative ‘ strepitu,’ ‘ventis,’ and the
rather harsh zeugma by which ‘ audis ’
is constructed with ⁴ ut glaciet nives!
But compare 1. 14. 6 and Virg. Aen. 4.
490 ‘mugire videbis Sub pedibus terram
et descendere montibus ornos.’

’8. puro numine. ‘ Numen’ is
dlvine power in exercise; ‘numine
glaciet nives,' as Virg. Aen. 4. 269
⁴ caelum et terras qui numine torquet.’
⁴ Puro‚' osa clear sky, as ‘ IuppiteruviduS,’
‘frigidus,’ etc. The ancients had ob-
lserve?c that cold is greater with a cloud-
ess s y.

ιο. ‘ Lest rope and wheel run back
together? Clearly a proverbial expres-
Sion, though the origin is uncertain.
The best illustrationis that quoted from
Lu'cian: σὺ δὲ πάνυ χαλεπὴ ἀεὶ τῷ ἀν-
θρωπφ γεγένησαι, καὶ ὅρα μὴ κατὰ τὴν

:3353 ἆῗέιζῆξνῖἰῖἒὲεᾝὲϋῗῖιιῖἓ

too sar ipewnl break, the πέξεί ywill
spin round the wrong way, and the
weight fall back again. Lyce must
not overdo her co or she will
exhaust the patience of Venus and of
her lover.

retro, constr. ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with ‘cut-
rente ' and with ⁶ eat? μ

12. ‘Your father was a Tusenn5 you

are no Penelope to resist suitors.' For ” ”’

the form cp. Virg. Aen. 3. 42 {non me
tibi Troia Externum tulit?

- Tyrrhenus, perhaps only ⁸ we know
all about you; you must not set up sor
more than you are.’ But the Enusoens
seem to have had a bad name for luxu—
rious living.

14. tinctus viola pallor, generally
interpreted like Virg. E. 2. 48 ‘pallentes
violas,' of the yellow violet. It appears
to have been taken so by Calpurnius
(Ecl. 9. 40) of an unhappy lover, ‘Palli-
dior buxo violaeque si “ ” us erro!
But the words themselves more natur-

ally suggest Ritter’s interpretation, ‘ sub-

lividus? df a pale faoe soored with dark ’

lines under the eyes. ⁸ ,

15. Pieria, from the borders of Ma-
cedonia and Thessaly, · as ‘Thressa
Chloe?

17. rigida aesculo, seems to· be a
continuanoe of the image of ‘curvatg
‘Youareashardtobendasanoak
bough.’ μ
