of the name to a special character, as ‘Cyrus‚’ 1. 17. 25, 1. 33. ⁷ ‚

63 ‘Pholoe,’ 1. 33. 7, 9, 2. 5. 17, 3. 15. 73 ‘Telephus,’ 1. 13.
1, 3. 19. 26, 4. 11. 213 ‘Lyce‚’ 3. 10, and 4. 133 but this last
instance (viewed in light of the general relation of Book iv. to the
earlier Books) points to the explanation that it is in all cases a
literary identity‚ a reminiscence of a previous poem, not of a living
person. On the other hand, the same name is at times given
to people of such different characters or ages, that those who would
give them real existence are obliged to recognise more than one owner
of the name; cp. the Phyllis of 2. 4 and 4. 11, the Chloris of 2. 5
and 3. 15, the Lalage of 1. 22 and 2. 5, not to say the Glycera
of 1. 30 and 1. 33. There are cases, doubtless‚ where a reality is
given to unknown names by their being brought into close relation
with real persons and events, such as ‘Mystes‚’ the lost friend of
Valgius, in 2. 93 ‘Damalis‚' who is to rival Bassus in draughts of
wine at the feast on Numida's return, 1. 36 3 ‘Glycera,' to whom
Tibullus is supposed to write piteous elegies, 1. 33. In this last case
we note that Glycera is not a name that occurs in Tibullus' extant
elegies, which suggests the possibility that even in such instances as

, these, though the reference be real, the name may be fictitious. This

is of course the ultimate refuge of those who would see in the heroines
of the Odes real persons. The names they give up; but Horace, it
is argued, may have concealed the true names, as tradition tells us
(see 2.12 Introd.) Catullus concealed the name of Clodia under that
of Lesbia, Propertius that of Hostia under that of Cynthia, Tibullus
that of Plania under that of Delia, etc.; and Horace himself, in the
Epodes and Satires, the name of Gratidia under that of Canidia 3
it is even added (see ibid.) the name of Terentia, Maecenas' wife,
under that of Licymnia. The possibility cannot be denied, but the
suggestion leaves us much where we were as to any canon by which
to know true persons from imaginary ones. No tradition helps us,
and Estre observes that the only instances of such concealment of
real names for which any tradition vouches are instances where the
true and false names were metrically equivalent‚ a requirement which
makes havoc of several schemes of ‘ amores Horatiani.' We should'
still have to leave as the representatives of different persons names ¹
which suit almost every metrical foot of two, three, or four
syllables.

There is one unknown name in the Odes, that of Cinara (Od. 4.
1. 4, 4. 13. 21, 22, Epp. 1. 7. 28, 1. 14. 33), which is perhaps
redeemed srorn this shadowy existence, both by the personal feelings
