LIB. Ι. OD. 3. 23

ODE III.

‘ Ο sum, in which virgil is sailing to Greece, carry thy precious burden safely.
' J* is a dreadsul risk‚ the sea. He was a hard, bold man who first ventured upon
, it. The gods meant it to be a barrier impassable, but man delights in disobe-
³ dience. Prometheus brought fire on earth and sickness with it. Daedalus tried
to fly. Acheron was no barrier to Hercules. VVhere shall >we stop? and when
will Jove be able to lay aside' his bolts of wrath ‘P'

This Ode has been very generally referred to the voyage of Virgil to Athens,
’ from which he returned only to die in nc. 19. This. however, would fix its com-
‘· position four years later than the date which the considerations suggestion by Od. χ

      
  
     
   
   
  
    
   
     
  
      
     
  
     

· 1. 12 lead us to assign to the publication of Books i-iii; nor is it an Ode which
⁴ ’ seems very likely to have been inserted after publication. Given to the world in
Virgil's lifetime, it seems playful and affectionate, but it would seem cold and
irrelevant to be published after his early death, and in a volume in which it was
'— thesole record of their friendship. Franke felt the difficulty so much that he pro-
⁷ posed to read ‘ Quintilium ’ for ⁴ Virgilium‚' thinking that he could trace a corre-
. spondence between this Ode and 1. 24, especially in v. 11 ‘heu non ita creditum-⁸
' It has even been suggested that it may have been another Virgilius, as is the case
J probably with Od. 4. 12. The simplest solution would be that the reference is to
another voyage. All we know even of the voyage in 1³42ss 19 is due to the frag-
mentary biography which goes byxthe name of Donatus, and which is not su} posed
Ϊ · to be earlier than the fifth century)
For other notices of Horace’s friendship for virgil, cp. Sat. r. 5. 403 6. 55. The
” form of the Ode may have been suggested by a poem of Callimachus‚the beginning
of which is preserved ε- 'Nx
ἆ ναῦς ἃ τὸ μόιῖονφέγγοε ἐμὸν τὸ γλυκὺ τᾶς (ocis
ἅρπαξας, nori τυ Ζᾶνος ἷκνεῦμαι λιμενοσκόπω. .
Statius' Qfflmjcon Metio Celeri: Sylv. 3. 2. is in great part an expansion of
1 Horace’s poem. We may contrast Horace’s wishes for the voyage of an enemy,

The tirade against sea-travelling as one form of man's restless audacity is in part
ἤ -ΡΙαγῇιΙς and as Profi Sellar (Roman Poets of the Augustan Age, p. ¹30) suggests,
adapted to Virgil's own temperament and expressed feelings: but Horace recurs
‚ to the idea that commerce and the mingling of nations are against nature and
γ a source of evil, and that if the golden age could return they would cease:
