’ 300 HORATII CARMINUM

ODE XI.

‘ Μγ wine is ready, and we are all astir preparing the feast3 {or it is the Ides of
April, Maecenas' birthday. Come, then, Phyllis, and keep itwith me; never mind
Telephus. What are such ambitious loves to you? Come, thou last of my flames
(it shall be so, Ι swear), come, and let us sing together.' ·

Compare 3. 28, where he invites Lyde to spend the Neptunalia with him. The
point of this Ode seems to lie, not in the invitation to Phyllis, which is only an
incident of the holiday-keeping‚ but in the occasion, Maecenas’ birthday. Ι

Whether the Ode was written at the time of the leading Odes of the Book is
perhaps more than we can say; but it characterizes fitly the relations of the poet,
and his early patron at that time. ⁷
