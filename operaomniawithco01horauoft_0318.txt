16. peritura vidit, ‘looks up and
sees a moment before she dies by his
unfleshed tooth.’ The repetition ‘ vidit:
‘ videre‚’ points the correspondence, and
makes it easier ‚to dispense with a more
formal introduction of the apodosis; see
on 2. 9. 9.

17. Raeti . . Vindelici. It is hard
to say which is the adjective. Geogra-
phically Raeti is the larger name of the
two, being, used to cover Vindelicia
(Raetia secunda) or the northern slopes
of the Alps, from the Lakeof Constance
to the ,Inn, as well eas Raetia prima,
the southern part of the Grisons and the
western Tyrol. Horace has the author-
ity of Dio C. 54. 22, in giving the com-
mon name os Raeti to the tribes which
Tiberius (Od. 4. 14. 14) and Drusus
conquered. But it is certainly a perver-
sion of the ordinaryyusage to assign the
Vindelici, both here and in 4. 14, to the
invader who approaehed from the south.
The geographical difficulty is unaffected
by the question of reading raised by
Heinsius, Bentley, and others, as whe-
ther we read ‘Raetis’ or ‘Raeti,' the
two names will still be given to one
locality, and that the scene of Drusus'
victory. The MSS. and Aer. are in
favour of the nominative. The ablative,
distributing the two names between the
mountains and the peop ple, would be
more in accordance with Horace’ s style,
and it would avoid the awkwardness,
however it be explained, of the double
designation-

prosaie introduction‚ contrasting awk-

< le gend, such as Porph.

wardly with the smooth finish of Ho-
race's style, is an intentionaL if not very

successful, imitation of Pindar. Cp. a ·

slighter instance in 3. 4. 69. Many
critics (Lambinus, Buttmann, Meineke,

condemn the lines as an interpolation,
supposing the sentence to haverun‘vin-
delici diu’ or ‘Vindelici et diu? But
the faults os the verses are such as the

poet is much more likely to have been ³

guilty os than an imitator. They formed
part of the text in the time of Servius
(on Virg. Aen. 1. ²43)-

22. The tennination of the on

to the straight course of the nanutive, is
after Pindar. ‘Sedx like δ’ οὖν in the
