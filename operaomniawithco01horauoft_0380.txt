’ HORATII EPODON

Sectus flagellis hic triumviralibus
Praeconis ad fastidium
Arat Falerni mille fundi iugera
Et Appiam mannis terit,
Sedilibusque magnus in primis eques 15
Othone contempto sedet!
Quid attinet tot ora navium gravi
Rostrata duci pondere
Contra latrones atque servilem manum
Hoc, hoc tribuno militum? ’ 20

hue et hue. In prose it would be
rather ‘hue et illuc' ; ep. Epod. 2. 31
‘hinc et hinc? .

10. liberi-imm Epod. 11. 16 ‘libera

ing verses represent the actual expres—
sion of the indignation. This is clear,
as Ritter points out, from the change
from the second person to the third.

11. triumviralibus; Dict. Ant. s.v.
‘Triumviri capitales.' They had the
power of inflicting summary punishment
upon slaves.

12. praeconis ad fastidium, ‘ till
the crier was tired.' What part the
crier played in the chastisement does not
appear. The editors say that he had to
go on proclaiming the culprit's offence,
but they allege no adequate authority.
Porph.’s note is ‘donec . . praeco cum
vellet desinere iuberet.’

13. Falerni, some of the best land
in Campania. The Scholiasts remark
that in Italy the vines are trained on
trees, and the ground between them
ploughed and sown. The Appian way
is perhaps named as the road which he
would naturally traverse on his way

between Rome and his estate. -

15. ‘Sits grandly as a knight in the
front seats, and snaps liis fingers at
Otho.’ He has no fear of a prosecutfion
under Otho’s law for taking a seat in the
fourteen rows reserved for the ‘ equites '
and persons ‘ equestri censu? for he is
possessed of far more than the requisite
income of 4oo‚ooo sesterces; cp. Epp. 1.

1. 58, 62. For other references to, this ,

law of L. Roscius Otho see Cic. Mur.
19, JuV. 3. 159, 14. 324. It would seem
from the allusion here, as well as from
other considerations, that the purpose
of the law was exclusive and aristo-
cratic.

navium rostrata’ = ‘ships with their

Perhaps we may compare Homer's νῆεσ
μιλτοπάρῃοι, and Aeschylus' co‘nverse use
pf πρὼρα and καλλίπρωροε, of the human

18. duci seems to imply that an ex-

against Sextus Pompeius and his ‘gang
