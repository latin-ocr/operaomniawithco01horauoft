CARMEN SECULARE.

⁴ Puomws and Diana, grant the prayers duly offered at this sacred season (v.
1-8).

O sun, ever changing yet ever the same, let Rome’s pre-eminence be as change—
less (v. 9-12).

Diana, birth goddess, guard our mothers (v. 13—16).

Bless our new marriage laws to the increase of our people‚ that each ‘⁸ seculum ”
may find us still celebrating this festival (v. 17-<24).

O Destinies‚ fulfil the happy oracles, and add future to past blessings ; fertility
of earth and cattle; seasonable rain and pure air (v. 25-32).

Apollo, hear us boys (v. 33, 34).

Diana, hear us girls (v. 35, 36).

If Rome is your creation, the remnant saved *from Troy for Aeneas' piety, give
our youth Aeneas’ manners, and our old men his happy old age. Give Rome all
blessings (v. 37-48).

And grant the prayers now offered by Aeneas‘ great son. He has subdued
the Mede, the Scyth, the Indian. He has restored peace and virtue and plenty
’ (v. 49—60).

Phoebus, pleased with his Palatine temple, promises another lustrum and in-
creasing years of prosperity (v. 61-68).

Diana listens to the ‘⁸ quindecimviri,'’ and the chorus of boys and girls3 and all
the gods approve and join in their blessing ' (v. 69—76).

That there was some division of parts between the male and female singers
seems probable on the face of the Ode, and the Sibylline verses (v. 20) seem
to speak definitely of such a division. It is not so easy to see what the division
was. Steiner arranges the Ode as follows :—

Str. 1. 2, proodus, boys and girls together.
str. 3 4 str. 9 mesodus str. 10 11
5 } boys 6 }girls W. 1, 2 boys 12 } boys 13} girls
7 8 3, 4 girls 14 15
str. 16-19, epodus, boys and girls together.
Ritter amends this arrangement by assigning 10-12 to the boys, 13-15 to the
girls ; 16 to the boys, answered to by 17 from the girls. Then in 18 the girls

begin, and would be answered in a similar way by the boys, but this is changed into
a final strophe by the united choir.

There are obvious difficulties in the way of both.
