greedy as himself? ‘Destinata’ agrees
with an ablative ‘,’aula understood.
Conington points out that the phrase-
ology,‘ aula: ‘destinata,’‘ rapacis‚’ is
chosen so as to suggest a comparison
between Death and the ‘dives herus’
himself (see on 3. 24. 5), ‘Meantime
Death more punctual than any con-
tractor, more greedy than any encroach-
ing proprietor, has planned with his
measuring· -line a mansion of a different
kind, which will infallibly be ready
⁷ when the day arrives-⁹

30. Orci fine. Ritter takes this as
a local ablative: ‘in finibus Orci‚'
quoting for the singular, Od. 1. 34. 11
‘Atlanteas finis? It is more probably
instrumental, ‘by the limit of Orcus'
being equivalent to· by Orcus, who sets
a 1111111 to all things.y ‘Mors ultima
linea rerum, 'Epp. 1. 16. 79. There may
be a remembrance of the Gr. τέλος
θανάτοιο. That it should interfere to
some extent with the personifioetion
would not, in interpreting Horace, be
a fatal objection (see on 1. 35. 21, 2.- 16.
21), but perhaps the limit which Death
sets to life and its plans may be allowed
to stand sor the measuring-rod with
which he traces the place and bounds
of the mansion which he prepares sor
the living. ‘Destinare’ is especially
used os tracing out the site for a building.
Bentley quotes the Culex 391 6 Consor-
mare locum capit impiger hunc et in
orbem Destinat?

Other ways of taking the lines are:
(1) to make ‘destinata’ agree with ‘fine'
in the sense os ‘than the end, of
Orcus already traced for him’; (2)
to take ‘destinata' as a nominative
with ‘faula ‘no house that he has

planned awaits him more surely than
1115 511(1 of Or';cus (3) with Bentley to
understand‘ certior’ of the comparative

certainty of death to the rich and the
poor. ‘ Nulla certior (h. e. non certior)
aula manet divitem herum [quam pau-
perem clientem] designata et descripta
termino ipsius Orci (h. e. aeque spatiosa
ac ipse Orcus).' All these sacrifice a
good deal of the personification of
Orcus, which seems to be implied in the
remainder of the Ode, Bentley's most
of all, so much so that he wishes to
read ‘capacis' It is to be observed ¹
that his interpretation really necessitates
this change, and this necessity is fatal to
it. Death must, on his view, be repre-
sented as a boon, otherwise the sentence
should have run ‘non certior manet
pauperem quam divitem!

contrast (which has a direct application
to the oppressor) between proud Tan-

We seem to have a fresh point added
to the legend here. The‘ satelles Orci’
