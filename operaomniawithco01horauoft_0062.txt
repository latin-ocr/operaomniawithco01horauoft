20 HORATII CARMINUM

Iactat ultorem, vagus et sinistra
Labitur ripa Iove non probante u-
xorius amnis. , 20
Audiet cives acuisse ferrum,
Quo graves Persae melius perirent,

21. cives. The purpose for which

partly by the emphasis on ‘cives‘ ; not as
soldiers, nor as Romans against fo·
reigners, but as citizens, in pursuance

ι osan intestine, civil quarrel; see on Od.

1. 3²· 5, and 1. 35. 34. Compare the
