14 HORATII CARMINUM

Sunt quos curriculo pulverem Olympicum
Collegisse iuvat ‘metaque fervidis

Evitata rotis palmaque nobilis 5 v
Terrarum dominos evehit ad deos; ⁵
Hune, si mobssium turba Quiritium

‘ rerum tutela mearum; ’ Virg. G. 2. 40
‘ O decus, O famae merito pars maxima
nostrae? Notice that here, as with the
corresponding word in the other pas
sages, ‘ meum’ is in the emphatic place,
‘to me.'

3. sunt quos . . iuvat. ‘Sunt qui'
may take either a subjunctive, in which
case ‘qui ' has its consecutive force :
‘ sunt qui dicant,‘ ‘there are people to
sayz’ or an Indicative, in which mse
‘sunt-qui,’ like ⁴ nescio quis,’ becomes
a new pronoun, the subject of a definite
categorical statement. The former is
the more Latin construction, more con-
sonant with the usages of the Relative,
and is preferred in prose, although the
Indioetive is also found, as in Sall. Cat.
19. 4, where see Kritz’ note. Horace,
swayed perhaps by his love of Greek
constructions‚ prefers the Indicative,
after the model of εἰσὶν οἵ. Cp. Od. 1.
7. 5, Sat. 1. 4. ¹24, 2. 1. 1, etc. But he
uses the Subjunctive also, Sat. 1. 2.
28, 1. 4. 74, Epp. 1. 1. 77. In Epp. 2. 2.
183 ⁶ Sunt qui non habeant, est qui non
curat habere‚' he seems to use the two
constructions as a means of contrasting
the vagueness of a general statement
with the definiteness of a known par-
ticular instance. ‘There are who have
not, 1 know one who cares not to
have?

curriculo ⁴may mean either the
‘course‚’ as in Cic. Mur. 27 ‘quadri-
gamm curriculum‚’ or the ‘ chariot‚’ as

ξι in Ov. Trist. 4. 8 ‘ cuniculo gravis est
ξ sacta ruina meo!

4. collegisse. On comparison with
Sat. 1. 4. 31 ⁸ pulvis collectus turbine,'
perhaps rather ‘to have raised a cloud
of dust‘ than ‘to have become dusty.’
The perf. may be regular, but see on 3.
4. 52.

fervidis, Virg. G. 3. 167 ‘volat vi
fervidus axis;‘ the object was to round
the ‘metae’ as closely as possible, and
with the chariot going at full speed.

.- 5. palma nobilis, ‘the palm of
glory,’ Paus. 8. 48 ἐι δὲ τὴν δεξιάν ἐστι
καὶ πανταχοῦ τῷ νικῶν-ἐι ἐστιθέμενος

Φθινῖξ-

6. terrarum dominos. The-inter-
pretation of these words must depend
to a great extent on the decision of the
question discussed in the next note.
(1) If the punctuation given 'm the text
is adopted, so that v. 6 belongs to the
preceding sentence. they may best be

taken with Dillenburger as=‘quasi sint
facti tenarum domini,’ ‘raises them to. ’ἴ
heaven, very lords of the world: i. e. in ’

their own feeling and estimation. Cp.
Od. 4. 2. 17
PaLma caelestes.’ Ovid (ex Pont. 1. 9.
36) gives the title ‘ Terrarum domini' to
the gods themselves, and so it is taken
here by many editors. The force would
really be the same; for to name a, spe·
cial characteristic of the
effect to quality the sense of ‘evehit ad
deos‚’ ‘raisoe them to the gods in so
far as the gods are “ terrarum domini,’''

‘makes them like gods. lords os the Γ

world! A less probable view, follow-

ing Lucan’s use of the words (8. 208, of J

Eastern princes), makes them the direct
object of ‘evehit' and understxnds .
them of the princes celebrated by

Pindar, as Hiero, Thero, etc.-’ (2) Isthe ’
to the sentence which ·

taken, according to· the suggestionsfirst

made by Glareanus, as a designationi “

of the Romans who are cornu-‚natea wida
the Greeks, the objects of the, preceding
verses. Cp. the contrast of the- two

peoples in the parallel Od. 4. a. 3-9. .

The expression would then be thes-me
