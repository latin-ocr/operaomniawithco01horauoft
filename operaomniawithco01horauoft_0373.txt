LIBER. EPOD. 2.

Aut in reducta valle mugientium Ι
Prospectat errantes greges,
Inutilesque falce ramos amputans

Feliciores inserit,

Aut pressa puris mella condit amphoris,

15

Aut tondet infirmas oves;

Vel cum decorum mitibus pomis caput
Auctumnus agris extulit,

Ut gaudet insitiva decerpens pira,

Certantem et uvam purpurae,

Qua muneretur te,

20
Priape, et te, pater ’ s

Silvane, tutor finium!
Libet iacere modo sub antiqua ilice,
Modo in tenaci gramine.

pasturing of cattle seems out of place
between the more cognate operations os
transplanting vines and grafting fruit-
trees. But it is scarcely possible that
the mistake should have vitiated every
’ existing MS. Bentley points out that
the two operations are, after all, very
distinct, and belong to different times of
the year. The feeling of the passage is
the great ehoice of pleasant tasks which
the countryman enjoys, and the sense of
this would perhaps be diminished rather
thar} increased by sorting them too
nloe y.

10. altas answers to ‘ adulta'; the
plants are now (in three years, Col. de
Arb. 7) grown large enough to clam-
ber a tree, which would have been
too tall for them before. Ritter points
out that ‘altas’ appeals to the eye,
as does ‘prospectat' in the next eou-
plet. His labour is associated with
pleasant sights and sounds. For the
metaphor of ‘ maritat’ cp. Od. 2. 15. 4,
4. 5. 30.

13. que. It is better to take ‘que’
as disjunctive (see on Od. 1. 3. 9 and 3.
11. 49), than with Bentley to alter it
here and in v. 63 to ‘ve.’

14. feliciores, as Virgil, of the* grafted
tree, G. 2. 81 ‘ Exiit ad caelum ramis
felicibus!

16. infirmas. The Scholiast inter-
prets ‘ unable to bear the weight of
their wool'; but it is probably no
more than an habitual epithet=‘ molle
pecus‚’ and only in point as helping the

general idea of peaeesulness‚ ‘ the unre-
sisting sheep!

17. vel, see on v. 9—1 2. Macl. rightly
points out that the uses of ‘vel cum.'
in an elliptical construction with no
apodosis (as in Virg. Aen. 11. 406),
although quoted by Orelli and others,
are not relevant. Sat. 2. 7. 95 is a real
parallel. The apodosis here is ⁸ ut gau—
det,' ‘ how he rejoicesl' cp.v.61‘ut iuvat.'

19. gaudet decerpens, a Greek use
of the participle, ἥδεται δρέπων.

20. certantem purpurae, ‘ rivalling
the purple dye ’: for dative ep. 1. 1. 15
‘luctantem fluctibus‚' etc.

21. Priapus is to be paid as the pro-
tector osgardenS. Virg. E. 7. 33, Catull.
20. Silvanus is not only, asin Od. 3. 29.
ἓὲ’«ῗέῃῖἓᾷᾱέῖζθίζὲοξῑιῗὲἑῑἲὲὲῗἓὶἓῖἷξῖἔί
pecorisque deus‚’ Virg. Aen. 8. 601, and
specially under the title of ⁶ Silvanus
orientalis‚’ like Terminus, a protector of
the sacred ‘ landmark,’ the symbol of
property, Dict. Biog. s. v.

²3· Some good MSS. (not B, nor, as
far as appears, V) begin a new Epode
here, and Acron supports thern, writing

at v. 1 ‘ Laus vitae rusticae,' and here ,

‘ Introducit quendam feneratorem lo-
quentem et laudantem vitam quietam
nec tamen suum propositum deseren-
tem.' Porph. gives no indication. See
Introd. to Od. 1. 7.

24. tenaci seems to mean ‘soft and
deep‚’ that makes a couch from which
you do not slip.
