9. ultimos, ‘remotis . .Britannis,’
Od. 4. 14. 47. Cp. Virg. E. 1. 67‘ pe-
nitus toto divisos orbe Britannos’3 for
the genitive‘ orbis’ cp. ‘Extremi homi-
num Morini,’ Virg. Aen. 8. 727.

30. recens examen, Aesch. Pers.
126 πᾶς γὰρ ἱππηλάτας καὶ πεδοστι-
βὴε λεὼ* σμῆνος (ias ἐκλέλοιπεν μελισ-

” σᾶν. Horace uses the metaphor of

slages clustering round the fire, Epod.

32. Oceano rubro, the Indian
Ocean with its two arms, the Persian
Gulf and the Red Sea. The intended
expedition to Arabia did not actually
toadke place till 1³..c 24, see Introd. to

1. ²9·

33. cicatricum et sceleris. The
expression is of the nature of what
grammarians call hendiadys. In prose
⁴· the ideas would be grouped morelogi-
cany. The real object of the feeling of
‘shame ' is one, viz. the ‘ guilt ’ of civil
war3 the ⁶ scars ' are only its memorials,
the ‘brotherhood’ of the combatants

1 its aggravation. We are not ashamed
γ of them in the same sense that we are

⁷„ ashamed of the guilt· but the feeling

of guilt comes to us through divers

Ἴ approaches. The poet: whose purpose

it is to wake feeling, tries them in suc-

9 cession.

34. fratrumque, Virg. G. 2. 510
⁸ gaudent perfusi sanguine fratrum.'
The absence of any definite qualification

, of ‘fratrum‚' such as ‘a fratribus occi·

sorum:

is due partly to the fact just
noticed that the word is not intended to

·, convey the full feeling; it is only one

approach among several 3—the thought

of brothers is a shameful thought to

Romans, because they would think also t·

how brothers had been treated, as the
thought of scars was shameful‚ because
they could not¹⁴ but remember the quarrel

uin which they had been come by-partly

to the fact that ‘ fratrum ’ as a correla-
tive term„leads our thoughts to its cor-
relative ; of ‘ brothers' conduct,’ means of
their conduct as brothers, and so to-

hwards their brethren. Cp. the pregnant

use of ‘cives’ in Od. 1. 2. 21.
more definite expression of the horror
of fratricidal war is purposely avoided
and sunk in the general question‘ quid
nos refugimus' ¹? With the string of
questgons that follow, cp. Od. 2. 1.

has‘ ydefinga s, 'which Bentley adopted,
altering at the same time‘ retusum? the
unanimous reading of the old MSS.. to
‘ recoctum‚’ ‘melt and forge anew.'
The verb ‘diffingere’ is found in no
other author, and in Horace only here
and in Od. 3. 29. 47 ‘neque Diffinget
infectumque reddet.' The Scholiasts in-
terpret it here ‘ refabricare‚’ ‘ reformare:
there ‘immutare’ It seems to mean
‘to make differently‚’ i. e. (in this case)
‘to a different purpose.’ The swords
have been blunted in civil war, they are
to be beaten straight and sharp again
for a foreign enemy. For the linage cp.
Virg. Aen. 7. 636 ‘recoquunt patrios
fornacibus enses.

40. Massagetas, a tribe living to
the east of the Caspian.
