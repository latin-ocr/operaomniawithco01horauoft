174 HORATII CARMINUM

Alexandriam (a town in the Troad) vel Ilium translatis simul opibus imperii
exhaustaque Italia delectibus et procuratione urbium amicis permissa.’ It has
been suggested that this idea imputed to Caesar, and eventually carried out by
Constantine, may have been in men’s minds, and that Horace, possibly at the
inspiration of Augustus, sets himself to discourage it. His protest, however, is an
empty one. The mythologiml argument could not be serious, and no other is
brought forward. Dillenburger, with more likelihood, imagines that the poet’s
purpose is to condemn Trojan manners, Asiatic perfidy and luxury, and that the
rebuilding of Troy ιε an allegory, suggested perhaps by the rumour before men-
tioned of Julius Caesar's design. Cp. Carm. Sec. 37 foll„ etc.

The Odeis more in Pindar’ s style than any that precedes it. The mythological
part of it occupies a larger space, is handled with more freedom, and is left more
completely to tell its own tale. Cp. 3. 11 and 3. 27.

Several MSS, including V and A (B omits Odes 2-6), wrote this Ode continu·

ously with the Second; and Porphyrion, noticing the question, decides that they·⁴ ’ὃ

‘manifeste cohaerent? The authon'ty of the MSS. on the point (see Introd. to 1.
7) is weakeued by the fact that the same ones join 2. ι5 and 16, evidently wrongly.
Ode 2 has no unity which would be injured by a closer connection with 3„and the
topic of its last two stanzas is not alien to the praise of justice and constancy.
Porphyrion is inclined to press too hard the connection between the six Odes; see

on v. 1. of Ode 4.
