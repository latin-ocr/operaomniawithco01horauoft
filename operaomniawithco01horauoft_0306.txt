9. tempestivius, ἱ you will be a more
*timely guest there.'

in domum. A rival reading with
good support is ‘in domo'; but her
‘ car of swans' implies that ‘ comissari’
is used rather in the Greek sense of
κῶμος, a moving band of revellers or
serenaders (Theoc. 3. 1 κωμάσδω ποτὶ τὰν
Ἀμαρυλλίδα), than in its more usual
Latin sense of a stationary revel. The
‚reading ‘comissabere’ is quitecertain,
but the unusual word makes great havoc
among the copyists. Some of the best
MSS. are at fault. ‘Comis habere‚’
‘ comitabere: ‘ commutabere,' etc. For
the future tense see on Od. 1. 6. 1.

10. Pauli Maximi. Two persons
are suggested, one or other of whom
may possibly be intended. (1) Paulus
Fabius Maximus, consul 13.c. 11, who
would now be, unless he were made
consul long before the regular age, about
forty years old 3 (2) his son or nephew,
Ovid‘s patron, an intimate os Augustus,
who was consul twenty years after-
wards. It is a question whether it is
least improbable that Horace should
call his middle-aged friend ‘puer‚’ making
the most os the ten years between them,
or that the younger ‘man should be
spoken of in such terms when a mere
boy.

purpureis ales olor-ibim, ⁴ on the
wings of lustrous swans‚’ i,e. in a chariot
drawn by them. Od. 3. 28. 15. For
‘purpureis' see on 1. 13. 2 ‘roseam
cervicem‚' Virg. Aen. 1. 590 ‘lumenque
iuventae Purpureum.'

r‚12.i‹÷eu1·; 1. 25.15.

idoneum, perhaps another reminis,
cence of 3, 26ss ¹1.

13. decens; 1. 4. 6.

⁷14. ‘No tongue-tied champion of ¹

trembling prisonersff Cp. 2. 1. 13 ‘in-
signe maestis praesidium reis.’

15. centum artium, the descriptive
genitive; Madv. ξ 287, with obs. 3.
It seems to have been almost a prover· ¹
bial expression. ‘ Omnium artium puer-
ulos: Cic. Rosc. Am. 41.

1 7. quandoque, usually = ‘ aliquando' ;
but *Horace uses it as = ‘ quandocunque.‘
Cp. Od. 4.. 2. 34, ,A- Ρ. 359.

potentior seems to some degree to
continue the metaph. of ‘ militiae tuae.’
⁵ So soon as he shall laugh triumphant
over the presents of his open-handed
rival! His rival mn rgivesricher pre-
sents3 Paulus fights and vanquishes him
with arms which Venus lends him—-
beauty, youth, etc. ‘ Munen’bus2 is the
ablative of comparison after ‘ potentior!

19. Albanos . . laeua, where Paulus,
it is implied, had a villa. The title in-
cludes the Lago d' ‘Albano and the Lago
di N emi,

20. ponet marmoream3 cp. Sat.⁴ 2.
3. 183 ‘ aeneus ut stes) and the promise
in Virg. E. 7. 31 ‘ Si proprium hoc fuerit
levi de marmore tota . . stabis! χαλκοῦν
τινὰ ἱστάναι is a common expression in
Demosth., as Fals. Leg. 425. 1.

citrea. The reading ‘ Cypria’ found
in a few good MSS, seems to be due to ”
the copyist's reminiscence of od. 1. 1.
13, where the connection is wholly ·
different. The ⁴ eitrus ' is mentioned
by Pliny (N. H. 13. 16) as much used
in temptes on account of the durability
of the wood. What it was is not so cer-
tain; apparently some kind of ress
or cedar; certainly different from the

(gnon, tge ‘ Medicum malum’ of Virg.
. 2. 12 .
