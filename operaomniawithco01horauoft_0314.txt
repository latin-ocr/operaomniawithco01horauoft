3. labor Isthmius, as in Pindar
κάματος and πόνος. Statius imitates it
in Silv. 4. 4. 31 ‘ Elei labores.’ ’

4. clarabit, a rare and archaie word,
not found elsewhere in this sense of
‘ make famous.’

5. ducet, not in the race, but rather
(with ‘ victorem ') in the triumphal pro-
cessions The double picture is com-
pleted in Horace's way: the chariot of
the Roman ‘imperator’ must be bor-

* rowed from the Greeian victor, the olive

wreath of the latter from the bay crown
of the former.

Achaico seems not to be opposed
to ‘Isthmius’ (as though it could sig-
nify distinctively ‘Olympian’)‚ but to
the Roman triumphal chariot described
in the following lines. Virgil and Ho-
race (Od. 1. 15. 35) use the word, like
the Homen‘c Ἀχαιοί, generally of the
Greeks before Tr0y3 and this would
nearly coincide with its prose meaning in
their time, as the province of Achaia
included all southern Greeoe.

dicra‚' ‘ war and all that helongs to it’;
