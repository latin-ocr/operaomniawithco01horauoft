’ 33. concines. We should rather
expect an emphatic ‘ tu.’ Cp. 2‘. 17. 30,
3. 17. 5. The ‘ego . . parvus’ of the
last stanzas contrasts not only with Pindar
before, but with Antonius ‘ maiore
plectro‚’ who follows. We may note,
also, that part of the contrast lies in the
occasion. ‘ Not now, neither you nor Ι.

By and bye, whenever it is that Caesar
’ comes home in triumph, a greater poet
than 1 shall sing his praises, and even I
(v. 45) shall find a voice in my delight?
‘ Maiore plectro ’ occupies a double
relation, as instrumental ablative with
‘ concines‚' and descriptive ablative with
‘ poe‘ta ’ ; see on 1. 3. 6. With the expres-
sion itself cp. ‘leviore plectro‚' 2. 1. 40,
‘ aureo plectro‚’ 2. 13. 26.

have won their purpose. Orelli men-

Horace is speaking, at the moment, not
of shouting with the shouting mob, but
of singing, i. e. writing poetry3 but there
is probably a metaphorical play in the

are well known, and no solution of them
