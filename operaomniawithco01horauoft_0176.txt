134 HORATII CARMINUM

Querceta Gargani laborant
Et foliis viduantur orni:
Tu semper urges flebilibus modis
Mysten ademptum, nec tibi Vesperq 10
Surgente decedunt amores ⁸
Nec rapidum fugiente S5lem.

At non ter aevo functuspamabilem
Ploravit omnes Antilochum senex

¹ Annos, nec impubem parentes 15
Troilon aut Phrygiae sorores
Flevere semper. Desine mollium
Tandem querelarum, et potius nova
Cantemus Augusti tropaea ι
Caesaris et rigidum Niphaten, 20

7. Gargani, a rocky romontory at
the north-east corner ofp Apulia. Cp.
Epp. ²3¹· 202 ‘ Garganum mugire putes
nemus.

- 9. tu semper. The absence of any
adversative particle to mark the anti-
thesis is supplied by the emphatic use
of the pronoun and the repetition of
‘semper' from v. x, see on 4. 4. 17.
Notice also the emphatic position of
‘ semper‚’ v. 1, ‘usque,’ v. 4, ‘ semper,’v.
1 .

7urge8‚ Prop. 4. 1 1. 1 ‘ Desine. Paulle,
meum lacrymis urgere sepulchrum.’
⁶ Urgere’ adds to some simple metaphor,
such as ‘prosequi,’ the idea of perse-
verance.

11. surgente, used inaccurately of
the stars coming into sight at night, as
in Virg. Aen. 4. 352 ‘ quoties astra
ignea surgunt.'

12. rapidum, ‘ striding‚’ helps the
metaphor of ⁴ fugiente.' Horace prob-
ably had in mind Virgil's ‘ Te veniente
die te decedente canebat‚’ G. 4. 465.

13. ter aevo functus, ‘ who lived
life three times over‚‘ seems (like Ci-
cero‘s ‘tertiam [Nestor] iam aetatem
hominum vivebat: de Sen. 10) to be an
exaggeration of the Homeric ἤδη δύο
μὲν ’γενεαὶ μερόπων ἀνθρώπων ἐφθίατο . .
μετὰ δὲ τριτάτοισιν ἄνασσεν, which
means only that the other princes were
the grandsons of Nestor's contempo-
raries. *The old age of Nestor, which
needed the support of a son, would
have excused his grief, as would ‚the
‘loveable’ character of his son. The

story of Antilochus' death, as he was
defending his father, is told in Pind.
Pyth. 6. 28 foll. >

15. impubem. His youth is meant ’

to add to the pathos, ‘ Infelix puer atque
impar congressus Achiui,’ Virg. Aen. 1.
4736. Troilon. His death does not
occur within the period of the Iliad:
it is just mentioned by Priam‚ 11. 24. ⁷
2 5 7. virgil (Aen. 1. 474 foll.) makes it
the subject of one of the paintings
which Aeneas saw in Dido’s hall.

Phrygiae sorores. This climax
points to the exhortation which sol-
lows: If barbarian women dried their
tears, perpetual lamentations may well
be called ‘ molles ’ in one who may sing
of the arms of Rome.

17. desine querelarum, after the
model of the Greek genitive with ταῦ-
εσθαι, λήγειν j, so Virg. Aen. 10. 441
‘ desistere pugnae! Horace similarly
copies the genitive with ἀπέχεσθαι, Od.
2. 27. 69 ‘ abstineto irarum,’ and with!
φθονεῖν, Sat. 2. 6. 84 ⁸ Sepositi ciceris
nec longae invidit avenae.’

20. rigidum Niphaten, ‘stiff frozen
Niphates.’ The later Roman poets took
it sor a river: Lucan 3. 245 ‘vol-
ventem saxa Niphaten‘; cp. Juv. 6. 409,
Sil. 13. 765: and this is perha the
most natural interpretation of irgil’s
metaphor, ‘ pulsum Niphaten-⁵ (cp. Aen.
11. 405 ‘retro fugit Aufidus’). The ’
geographers, however, recognize only
a. mountain of the' name in Arme-
ma.
