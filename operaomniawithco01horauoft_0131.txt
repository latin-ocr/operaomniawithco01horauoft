ΜΒ. 1. OD. 30. · 89

O DE XXX.

¹ Quum< Vanus, leave Cyprus and bring thy presence to the shrine which Glycera
offers thee, and bring with thee love and grace and youth and wit.'

The Ode is a hymn of the kind which the Greeks called κλητικοί, hymns of q
invitation; see on Alcman, F r.' 10. Ed. Bergk, Κύπρον ἱμερτὰν λιποΐσα καὶ Πάφον
περιρρύταν, a line of which we may possibly hear an echo in ‘Sperne dilectam

 

s Cypron!

Ο VENUS, regina Cnidi Paphique,
Sperne dilectam Cypron, et vocantis
Thure te multo Glycerae decoram
Transfer in aedem.
Fervidus tecum puer et solutis 5
Gratiae zonis properentque Nymphae
Et parum comis sine te Iuventas

Mercuriusque.

βωμός τε θυήειε; Virg. Aen. 1. 415. Taci-
tus describes the worship of Venus at

Paphos, Hist. 2. 2.

’ 2. sperne dilectam, Od. 1. 19. 9
‘Venus Cyprum deseruit.' So Faunus
must leave Lycaeus to visit Horace's
, Lucretilis: and Apollo, when he would
visit Delos, ‘deserit hibernam Lyciam,'
Virg. Aen. 4. 143.

4. aedem, ‘temple‚’ not ‘house,'
according to the distinction laid down
‘hy Bentl. on Epp. 2. 2. 92 between
‘aedes’ in the sing. and in the plur.
There is nothing strange in supposing
either that a little shrine or ‘ sacrarium '
, is dignified with the larger title, or that
the whole house is called a temple of
, the goddess.

5. fervidus, Virg. Aen. 1. 710 ‘ Fla-
< grantesque dei [Cupidinis] vultus?

⁴ solutis Gratiae zonis, Od. 3. 19. 16
‘Gratia nudis iuncta sororibus,’ cp. 4.
7. 5. Seneca describes the representa-
ζ tiens of them, de Ben. 13 ⁶ Tres Gratiae

sorores manibus implexis ridentes
iuvenes et virgines solutaque et pellu-
cida veste.’ The notion seems to be
the absence of restraint and of disguise—
the grace of nature. They are joined
with the nymphs in Od. 4. 7. 5, and in ’
1. 4. 6.

6. properentque. Dillr. has a note
(on Od. 2. 7. 25) on Horace’s not un-
common practice of joining an enelitic
particle to some word other than the
one which it logically couples to the
preceding clause. In all these cases
the word to which it is joined is em-
phatic and is usually a common element
in the two clauses, the verb or adverb
which gives their meaning to both, and
which is placed in this rway between
them in order to make us feel their
unity. Cp. ‘que' in Od. 2. 17. 16,
2. 19. 32, 3. 11. 13, C. S. 22, Sat. 1. 4.
115, 1. 6. 43, 44, 2. 1. 68, 2. 3. 1823 ‘ne'
in Sat. 1. 8. 2; ‘ve' in Od. 2. 7. 25, Epod.
2. 50, Sat. 1. 2. 63, 2. 3. 139 ,and 180.

8. Mercurius, as the god of speech
and wit. Compare Homer's descrip-
tion of Aphrodite’s cestus. 11. 14. 216
