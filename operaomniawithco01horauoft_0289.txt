LIB. III.

OD, 27. 247

Impudens liqui patrios Penates,

Impudens Orcum moror.

O deorum 50

Si quis haec audis, utinam inter errem

Nuda leones!

Antequam turpis macies decentes

Occupet malas teneraeque sucus

Defluat praedae, speciosa quaero 55
Pascere tigres.

Vilis Europe, pater urget absens:

Quid mori cessas?

Potes hac ab orno

Pendulum zona bene te secuta

Laedere collum. 60
Sive te rupes et' acuta leto
Saxa delectant, age te procellae

‘ tauri,’ but, as Orelli observes, this read-
ing was probably a gloss, helped to
usurp the text by v. 72. Europa has
called it, in v. 45, ‘infamem iuvencum‚’
but she has learnt long ago that it was

’ not merely what it seemed. It should

be noticed that Horace imagines the
bull to have vanished the moment he
has lauded Europa on the Cretan shore.
She is then alone, conscious that she
has been brought there for a bad pur-
pose, but thinking (vv. 63-65) of some
earthly ravisher, such as Paris, etc„ till
Venus appears to reconcile her to the
honour intended for her by Jupiter.

50. impudens. She repeats it, as
though she had now found the clue to
her conduct, ‘ shameless' from begin-
ning to end.

Ο Oreum moror, ‘keep Death wait-
ingl

51. si quis audis. The second person
of the verb is used by a kind of attrac-
tion‚ as the doubt ‘si quis¹ cannot be
addressed to a single person. ⁶ O dii, si
auditis‚' or ‘O deus, si quis deorum
audit.‘ Dillr. compares Virg. Aen. 4.
684 ‘ Exoriare aliquis nostris ex ossibus
ultor.'

5 3—56. The point of this stanza is not
quite obvious. Orelli thinks she depre-

’ cates a tedious death, and quotes Soph.

Ant. 817 foll. οὔτε φθινάσιν πληγεῖσα νό-
σοις, οὔτε ξιφέων ἐπίχειρα λαχοῦσ’ ἀλλ’
αὖτόνομοε ζῶσα μόνη δὴ θνατῶν Ἀΐδαν
καταβήσει. We might add the prayer
of the Chorus in Aesch. Ag. 1448 foll.

for death, but with the same reservation,
φεῦ τὶς ἃν ἐν τάχει μὴ περιώδυνος μήτε
δεμνιοτήρης μόλοι, κ. τ. λ. But probably
the thought is rather that she would
make haste and let her young beauty‚
the hated cause of her present condition,
gain her a death before it too vanished.
It may at least be of some use if it
makes her a dainty morsel for a tiger.
She loathes her beauty: it is not that
she would spare it from withering‚ or
herself from seeing it wither.

f 58. hae ab orno, ‘ you need not look
ar.' ’

59. bene=‘opportune'; cp. Aesch.
Suppl. 457 foll.

60. laedere, ‘to break'3 more usually
‘elidem’ a conscious μείωσιε. Cp.
Soph. Ant. 54 πλεκταῖσιν ἀρτάναισι
λωβᾶται βίον. It is a common mode of
sels-destruction in the heroic legends.
Cp. Jocasta (Ant. l.c.), and Antigone
herself, ib. 1221 τὴν μὲν κρεμαστὴν αὐχέ-
νος κατείδομεν βρόχῳ μιτώδει σινδόνος
(= ‘ zona ’) καθημμένην.

61. leto, the dative of the purpose
with respect to which they are sharp.
Dillr. points out the bitterness of ‘ delec—
tant.' The only reason the father for
the moment ean imagine why she should
not hang herself, is that she is caught
by the charms of some other form of
death.

62. procellae, the swist 3tormwind.
The idea seems to be that she is to trust
herself to the wings of the wind, which
will carry her quick to the bottom.
