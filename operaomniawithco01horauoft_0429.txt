lines having fallen out. It will be seen, on examination‚ that the diffi-

in obedience to the canon. Steiner pointed out that, whatever may
have been the case with the Odes which are composed in couplets,
there are but five other Odes besides 4. 8 (omitting, again, 3. 12)

x which are μονόστιχα, or of uniform metm, and that this is too small an

area for such an important induction.
