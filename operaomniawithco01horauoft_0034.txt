[Of the origin of the ‘cognomen' nothing can be guessed. The
‘nomen' might imply that his father, on manumission, had taken a Δ ,

gentile name from some member of the Horatia gens. It is now
more generally believed, on a suggestion of G.v F. Grotefend‚ that it

was derived from the Horatia tribus, the one of the country tribes in 3
which the colony of Venusia was enrolled, and to which Horace's '²

father, as a libertus of Venusia, would belong]

His sather's profissz'on.—‘ Coactor,' Sat. 1. 6. 86. [Suetonius, ‘co-
actor exactionum‚' ‘a collector of taxes.' He says, further, that
he was a ⁶ salsamentarius,' or dealer in salt-fish, and that Horace

was once taunted with this by one who said to him, ‘ Quoties ego ’

vidi patrem tuum brachio se emungentem.'] He had purchased
a small estate, Sat. 1. 6. 71. For Horace’s feeling towards his
father see Sat. 1'. 6, especially vv. 89-96.
