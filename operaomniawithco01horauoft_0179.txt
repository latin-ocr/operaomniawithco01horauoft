ODE· XI.

‘Do not trouble yourself with foreign politics, Quintius, nor with schemes of
business. Life wants very little, and it is flying fast: spring flowers die and moons ⁴
wane. Do not weary yourself over plans as if things remained for ever. Better
crown with roses our hairs already whitening with age, and drink and play while
we may.’

Nothing is known of Quintius Hirpinus; possibly he is the same as the Quintius
to whom Epp. 1. 16 is addressed. ⁵

The nature of the name ‘ Hirpinus· is not certain. It is very probably a local
name (as ‘Marrucine Asinil‘Catuu. 12. 1), the Hirpini being a Samnite tribe, of
which Beneventum was the capital.
