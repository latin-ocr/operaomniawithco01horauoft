· Libenter hoc et omne militabitur

Bellum in tuae spem gratiae,

Non ut iuvencis illigata pluribus ⁷ ²5
Aratra nitantur mea,

Pecusve Calabris ante sidus fervidum
Lucana mutet pascuis,

Neque ut superni villa candens Tusculi
Circaea tangat moenia. “ 30

Satis superque me benignitas tua
Ditavit: haud paravero,

Quod aut avarus ut Chremes terra premam,
Discinctus aut perdam nepos.

kind rather affected by Latin writers, e. g.
Ter. Ad. 4. 5. 34 ‘ cum hanc sibi videbit
praesens praesenti eripi?

2 3. militabitur bellum, as ‘ pugnata
bella,' Od. 3. 19. 4, Epp. 1. 16. 25.

’ 24. in spem, ⁶ to further my hope,’ as
‘ in hon'orem,’ Od. 1. 7. 8. .
gratiae is opposed to the more sordid
. objects which are repudiated in the fol-
lowing lines.

of prayer in Od. 1. 31. 3 soll. ⁶ Non opi-
mae Sardiniae segetes feraces Non ae-

Epp. 2. 2. 177, in a similar connection,
‘ Calabris Saltibus adiecti Lucani.’

mea. The best MSS. have ⁴ meis‚’
but the copyists seem to have got into
confusion between the terminations of
26, 28, and 303 ‘pascua' dividing the
older MSS. pretty equally with ‘ pascuis!
Sound and the balance of the adjective

· between ‘iuvencis ' and ‘ aratra ’ are in
favour of the nominative which is given
by Orelli, Dillr„ and Munro.

27. Orelli quotes Varro R. R. 2. 1. 16
⁴ greges ovium longe abiguntur ex Apulia

in Samnium aestivatum,' and ib. 2. 2. 9
‘ mihi greges in Apulia hibernabant qui
in Reatinis montibus aestivabant! For .
the construction of ‘mutet’ see Od. 1.

house on the outskirts of Tusculum! ’

30. Circaea, as he calls the same hill
in Od. 3. ²9· 8 ‘ Telegoni iuga parri-
cidae,' q. v.

31. Cp. Od. 2. 18. 52, 3. 16. 38.

33. Chremes, apparently a miser of
comedy‚ like the Euclio of the Aulularia,
but the play or author is not known.

34. discinctus. The word is used
literally or with no sense further than
⁴ at one’s ease‚’ in Sat. 2. 1. 73. It has
got here, and in later authors, the sense
of careless, loose, profligate—partly
through the association of this mode of
dress with idle and luxurious habits,
partly through the metaphorical colour
borrowed from the already established
use of ‘dissolutus’ The MSS. are di-
vided between ‘nepos’ and ‘ut nepos.'
Ritter thinks the repetition of the ‘ ut ’
forcible, quoting Epod. 5. 9, 10.
