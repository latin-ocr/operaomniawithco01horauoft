reading of the greatnumber of MSS, and

is, however, some reason for suspecting
that this reading was an early corrup-
tion. The minuteness of the local de-
scription and its paradoxical form have
no special point5 and the instances
quoted from other poets of variation of
the quantity in such names as Italus,

ltalia; Priamus, Priamides; Sicanus, ·
etc. are hardly parallel to the inversion ³.
of the quantity of two syllables in the ²2 ’
same word, in the same part of two ⁵
consecutive lines. It is doubtful, be· ἵ

shortened the first syllable of Apulia.
The only instance alleged is the ⁴ mare

ing is at least as doubtful as the present
one. Meanwhile, of the oldest MSS.

first reading, have ‘limina Pullie,’ and
the Scholiast on γ reads the same, and
explains it as the proper name of the
nurse. Aer. and Porph. seem to have
read ‘ Apuliae,' but, oddly, to have
interpreted it in the same way : ⁸ Fabu-

have here the name of Horace’s nurse,
