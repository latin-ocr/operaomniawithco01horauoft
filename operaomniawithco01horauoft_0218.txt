HORATII CARMINUM

Fatalis incestusque iudex
Et mulier peregrina vertit 20
In pulverem, ex quo destituit deos
Mercede pacta Laomedon, mihi
Castaeque damnatum Minervae
Cum populo ebduce fraudulento.
Iam nec Lacaenae splendet adulterae 25
Famosus hospes'nec Priami domus
Periura pugnaces Achivos
Hectoreis opibus refringit,
Nostrisque ductum seditionibus
Bellum resedit. 'Protinus et graves ’ 30
Iras et invisum nepotem,
Troica quem peperit sacerdos,

19. fatalis (cp. Adavaptffi—Aivdmpts),
⁶ doom-fraught.' The two epithets are
meant to have a close connection.

iudex, ⁴ manet alta mente repostum

Iudicium Paridis: Virg. Aen. 1. 26. ’

The epithet ‘incestus' is fitly applied to
him as ‘iudexff inasmuch as his judg-
ment was determined by Venus'promise,
τὴν δ’ ᾔνησ’ ἥ οἱ πόρε μαχλοσυνην ἀλε-
γεινήν, Hom. Il. 24. 30.

20. mulier peregrina. There is a Ι

scornful emphasis in the manner in
which Juno refuses to name Helen or
Paris.

vertit in pulverem, reduced to dust,
Gr. ἀμαθύνειν, as Hom. 11. 9. 593.

21. ex quo, construet ‘damnatum
ex quo,’ etc. The sentence was passed
at the time of Laomedon’s fraud; it
was executed in Priam’s time: so the
‘dux' of v. 24 must be Laomedon. For
the story of his cheating Apollo and
Neptune of their bargained wages sor
building the walls of Troy see Hom. 11.
23. 44² foll.

22. mercede pacta, an abl. absol..
we{effigzzezssrmeasssse
after the analogy of the ablative with
⁶ fraudare: e. g. ⁵ praeda,' Liv. 2. 4²-

mihj damnatum=‘addictum‚’ given
over for punishment, as Virg. Aen. 4.

² 699 ‘Stygioque caput damnaverat Orco.’

Bentley wished to read ‘damnatam '
against the MSS, as ‘obsessam Ilion ’ is
found in Epod. 14. 14, and he is sol-
lowed by Lachmann and Ritter. But
we have ‘llio superbo' in Od. »1- 10. 14,

and ‘Ilion’ is a nom. in Ov. Met. 6. 95.

2 3. castae, ‘bene autem “castam” ·
quia ‘⁴ incestus iudex ” dixerat? Aer.

24· fraudulento, the epithet is meant
for people and prince alike. ‘ Ima-¹
donteae periuria T roiae‚' Virg. G. 1.-‘
502, cp. Aen. 4. 541. -

25—28. Paris, the cause of the war,
{nd Hector, the bulwark of Troy, ane

ead.

25. adulterae, probably the dative
with ⁸ splendet,’ ‘adorus himself for
the eyes of’; ‚1. 5. 4 ‘cni religas
comam.’ With ‘splendet' cp. Hom. 11.
3. 392 κάλλεΐ τε στίλβων καὶ ἄμασιν. -

26. famosus, ‘ infamous,’ as in Sat.
1. 4. 5.

hospes, the relation that gave its
chief iusamy to Paris’ crime, ᾔσχυνε
{glan τράπεζαν κλοπαῖσι γυναικός. Aesch.

. 401.

28. reffingit, breaks their miset.
turns. ⁴ Danai . . decimum quos dis-
tulit Hector in annum,' Virg. Aen. 9.
154.

Sall. Jug. 643 ‘ prolonged by our quu-
rels,’ ‘ seditio ’ in the sense of πάσᾳ. ’

3ο. protinus, ‘this moment. 'aad
from henceforth.’ ·

31. nepotem, Romulus is the
sou of Juno as the son of Mm3 bis
birth is a fresh grievanoe besides the ,
‘graves irae' against his 'stojan nnn·
cestry. · ·

32. Juno will not name Rea silvia
afflans-effre affigam-..tax

29. ductum, as ‘trahere benum: Ὗ
