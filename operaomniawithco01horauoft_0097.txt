‘ F am daughter of a mother fair, though not so fair as you, burn and forget my
scurrilous iambics. Passion is as resistless as the afflatus of Cybele, or Apollo,
or Bacchus. We are all liable to it, we all have our share'of the lion’s heart.

’ ‘Hac ode παλινῳδίαν repromittit ei in quam probrosum carmen scripserat Tyn· :-
daridi amicae suae! Porph;
In accordance with this the Ode is headed in the MSS. B and A ⁸ ad Tyn-
dariden.'
⁸ Cantat palinodiam, i. e. mutando revocat quae scripserat iratus in amicam ’
Gratidiam: Comm. Cruq. And so some MSS. head it ‘Palinodia Gratidiae.'
Others unite the two views, and identify ‘ Tyndaris ' with ‘ Gratidia ’ or ⁶ Canidia ’;
⁸ Palinodia Gratidiae vel Tyndaridis!
For the first view, which identifies the unknown object of this palinode with the
Tyndaris of the following Ode, there seems to be no external argument. There
· was the temptation to connect the two 0des, to make the invitation of'that the‘
complement of the reconciliation in this; and the connection of the name of Helen
, on the one side with the name of Tyndaris, and on the other with the original
’ ‘ palinode,' would easily suggest to ingenious Scholiasts the desired link.
With respect to the second view the case is not so clear. If the ‘criminosi
,Ϊ iambi ’ here recanted are to be looked for among Horace’s extant poems. they can
-’ hardly be other than his attacks on Canidia in Epodes 5 and 17. TQ our ideas it
· is a slight recantation for such a libel, so much so that it might seem to force us to
, give both to the Epodes and to Sat. 1. 8 less reality than we should naturally give.
⁸· There is no bitterness in this Ode, nothing which would justify us in holding (for
⁸ ,this is one suggestion) that it is a continuation of the libel, the ‘tu pudica, tu proba’
, which he offered to sing, ‘mendaci lyra,' ⁸ tuning his harp to falsehood: in Epod.
⁶ 17. 39. ; but yet the tone of the palinode is barely serious. There is a mock heroic
¹ air in the ‘ urbes altae,’ ⁸ Thyestes,‘ ‘ Prometheus' (comp. Od. 2. 4, 4. 11. 25 foll„
and Epod. 3). It is intended, as Newman says, to make the occasion slightly
ridiculum», to represent both himself and the lady as having made too much of it.
Ι ’ The παλινῳδία of Stesichorus, which added to the legend of Troy the famous
ἶ ’ναι-ἰαῐίοῐι that it was—ffiffi phantom in Helen's shape that Paris carried from '
⁵ ; Mycenae, is mentioned by Plato, Phaedr. ²43 A, who quotes the first three
.·. lines :—
θ οὔκ ἐστ’ ἔτυμος λόγος οὗτος
οὐδ’ ἔβας ὲν νηυσὶν εὐσέλμοιο
οὔδ’ ἵκεο Πέργαμα Τροίας.
