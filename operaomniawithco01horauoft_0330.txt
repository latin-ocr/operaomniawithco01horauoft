288 HORATII CARMINUM

‘O D E VII.

‘ Smne has returned to earth, ‚and with it foliage and light and warmth. It will
not last for ever: this is the lesson of revolving seasons. Only they pass to return
agaim we, when we pass where the great-and good· are gone before uS‚ are dust
and nothing. To—day may be your last; who knows? Take your fill of enjoy-
ment. What you spend on yourself is at least so much the less sor your greedy
heir. When once you are dead and passed Minos' grand tribunal, neither race, ι
Torquatus, nor eloquenee, nor goodneSS, will restore you to the light. Think of
Hippolytus and Pirithous, and learn this lesson from their fate.¹

Torquatus is the same person, doubtless‚ whom Horace addressed in Epp. 1. 5,
to much the same purpose as in this Ode; but more than that it is difficult to say,
notwithstanding the many guesses that have been offered on the subject. Τὶιε two
most plausible ones are, (1) ‚that of Estre, who identifies with him the Aulus Tor-
quatus mentioned in Corn. Nep. Atticus, as amongst those who were compromised
by their share in Brutus and Cassius’ campaign, This would give an occasion for
Horace's acquaintancewith him, though the prominence whichris. given to him ,

will hardly suit a man of Horace’s own age or rank. (2) That of Weichert‚ who ' ’Ὗ

thinks that he was no member of th'e Manlia genS‚ but the C. Nonius Asprenas
mentioned by Suetonius (Aug. 43 and 56), the intimate friend of Augustus, who
had assumed for himself and his family the cognomen of Torquatus by permission
of the emperor, and in memory of a golden ‘torques’ with which Augustus had
presented him on the occasion of his injuring himself bya fall while performing
in the Ludus Troiae. His assumption of the name has been held to prove, what
there are no other facts to disprove, that the old family of Torquati was extinct.

The Ode is remarkably parallel to 1. 4 ; so much so, that Macleane ⁴is inclined
to think that it was omitted on· this account from the first three Books,22.nd only
published under the necessity of making up a respectable number to meet Augustus‘
requirement ofssa fourth Book. There is nothing to indimte its date.
