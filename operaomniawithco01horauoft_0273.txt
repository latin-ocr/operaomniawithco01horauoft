LIB. III. OD. 23. 231

-O D E XXIII.

⁴ Pau ‘duly at the new moons, O country housewife, and offer to the Lares frank-
incense and corn and a porker, and your wines and your crops and your flocks
shall be kept safe. Costly sacrifices a-re for the ‘⁵ pontificesl' Put your garlands of
rosemary and myrtle on the little images of your gods, and there is no need for
more. Without any gifts but the salted cake you may win their favour, as much
as by asumptuous victim.'

‘ The gods accept the humble offerings of humble people. Moderation‚ simpli-
city, thrift, content with our own station, have place in religious observance as
wellas in other phases of life? This is all the doctrine of the Ode. The name
Phidyle (Gr. fem. of Φειδύλος) is clearly chosen to characterise a ‘ th rifty' Sabine
housewise.

‘CAELO supinas si tuleris manus
Nascente Luna, rustica Phidyle,
-Si thure placa-ris et horna
Fruge Lares avidaque porca,
Nec pestilentem sentiet Africum 5
Fecunda vitis nec sterilem seges
'Robiginem aut dulces alumni
Pomifero grave tempus anno.

The hands were held open with the
palms upward. ‘Supinas ferre manus’
might be=xefpas ἀνασχεῖν, and be a
common way of saying ‘to pray’: pos-
sibly, in combinat-ion with the other
particulars, ‘nascente Luna‚’ ‘thure‚’
‘horna' fruge‚’ etc. it helps the idea of
punctual ritual performance.

2. nascente Luna, on the first of the
month; see on 3. 19. 9, Cato de R. R.

Ode find a parallel.

Why ‘ avida ' Ρ Ovid, speaking of sacri-
ficing a pig to Ceres (Fast. 1. 349),
makes its greediness the ground of its
fate: ‘ Nam sata vere novo teneris lac-
tentia succis Eruta setigerae comperit
ore suis.y But the pig does not offend
the Lares in this way. The epithetis
intended probably to help the feeling of
the samiliarity of the object, and so the
simplicity of the offering.

7. alumni; see on 3. 18. 4.

8. grave tempus, ‘the sickly time
when the year bears its fruits.’ For the
ablative see 2. 7. 16 ‘fretis aestuosis!
With ‘ pomifero anno ’ cp. ‘ annus hiber-
nus‚' Epod. 2. 293 sor the sickliness of
autumn cp. od. 2. 14. 15, Sat. 2. 6. 19.
