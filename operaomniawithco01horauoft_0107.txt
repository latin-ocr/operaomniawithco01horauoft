, An invitation to Maecenas to visit Horace at his Sabine sarm, where he will
· have not indeed the Caecuban or F alemian which he drinks at home, but Sabine
, wine, if cheap yet carefully bottled by Horace himself, and carrying in its date
a pleasant reminiscence of Maecenas' life, viz. of the rounds of applause with which
he was received on first entering the theatre after an illness.

On the date of this Ode, see Introd. to Odes i-iii, ς 8.
