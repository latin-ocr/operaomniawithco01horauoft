LIB. 1.

OD. 7. 35

Et praeceps Anio ac Tiburni lucus et uda
Mobilibus pomaria rivis.
Albus ut obscuro deterget nubila caelo 15
Saepe Notus neque parturit imbres
Perpetuo, sic tu sapiens finire memento
Tristitiam vitaeque labores
Molli, Plance, mero, seu te fulgentia signis
Castra tenent seu densa tenebit 20

Tiburis umbra tui.

Teucer Salamina patremque

Cum sugeret, tamen uda Lyaeo
Tempora populea fertur vinxisse corona,
Sic tristes affatus amicos:

Ibimus, o socii comitesque.

to some sulphureous springs near Lau-

' rentum.

. 13. Tiburni, acc. to Virg. Aen. 7.

67², Tiburnus (Virg. calls him ⁸ Tibur·
tus’), Catillus (‘Catilus,’ Hor. Od. 1.
18. 2), and Coras were three Argive

- brothers, founders of Tibur.

14. mobilibus rivis. Burn, 1. c. ‘A

¹· third portion of the Anio is diverted
⁴ just above the bridge into canals appa-
= rently of very ancient date, which, pass-
ing completely through the centre of the ,
, town, are used as the motive power of
⁷ watermills of every kind and then fall

’ *fin-¹2¹ (the falls known as the “ Cascat-
·· e e >into the main stream at various

'¹ points of the romantic cliffs on the
ἦ woetem hill side.’

15. albus, predicative. The south

⁵ ‘wind is sometimes λευκόνοτοε, not al-

4, ways ‘ niger Auster! The lesson is that
’ᾗ the very same wind which brings the
, clouds will presently clear them. ‘Al-
bus’ as ‘albus Iapyx,' Od. 3. 27. 19;
⁴ ‘madidi Favonii,‘ 3. 7. 1.
16. parturit, see on Od. 4. 5. 26.
17. saniona, ‘ be wise and remem-
ber‚’ etc.. Od. 1. 11. 6 ⁸ sapias, vina

19. molli, ‘ mellow‚' as ⁴ lene? Od. 3.

⁴ '²- 29. 2. It breaks the flow of the sen-
* tence needlessly to take ‘ molli,' with
ᾖ ⁷ Ritter, as an imperative.

πο. tenent . . tenebit, ⁸ as n0w‚’ ‘as

Α. '1 hy and bye.’ stress is clearly laid on the

- tenses, so that apparently Rlancus was

now, or might be supposed to be, cam-
paigning.

21 foll. This story of Teucer is not
found elsewhere, beyond the fact of his
being ill-received by his father Telamon
because he returned without Ajax, and
of his founding Salamis in Cyprus.
Cicero may possibly be referring to a
common source in Tusc. 5. 37 ‘ ad om-
nem rationem Teucri vox accommodari
potest: Patria est ubicunque est bene.'

22. cum fugeret, when he was start-
ing on his banishment‚ not ‘ during his
flight,' as though he had put in to shore
for the night, as some commentators
suppose, see on v. 32. ·

23. populea, sacred to Hercules, to
whom as a wanderer Teucer would
offer sacrifice; ⁴ vagus Hercules? Od. 3.
3. 9. Orelli quotes Xenophon, Anab. 6.
2. 9, who speaks of sacrificing τῷ ἡγε-
μόνι Ἠρακλεῖ.

27. duee et auspice, ‘ underTeucer's
conduct and Teucer's star‚' a curious
technicality of Roman military life to
put into Teucer's mouth. ‘Ductu et
auspicio‚’ Liv. 6. 123 ‘domuit partim
ductu partim auspiciis suis Cantabriam,'
etc.. Suet. Oct. 21. The two did not
necessarily belong to the same person.
The auspices were taken in the name
of the Imperator, and the ‘ felicitas' was
his, see Od. 4. 14. 33 foll. Horace has
not exactly reproduced the technical
phrase, for we find ‘auspiciis Camilli,
Augusti‚’ etc.. not ‘ auspice Camillo!
