Deterret ensis nec mare naufragum 10

ably from some fuller version of the ³-

legend), ‘ Sic timorem deprompsit a le-
pore, a volpe astutiam.'

16. vim, to be taken closely with
‘ insani? which defines its meaning, ⁴ the
force of the lion’s sury.’

stomacho, the seat‘ of anger, see on
Od. 1. 6. 6.

17. Thyesten. Thyestes stands as
the representative of the crimes of pas-
sionate revenge in Greek Tragedy. Cp.
Od. 1. 6. 8 ⁴ Saevam Pelopis domum.’

18. ultimae, the furthest off, the first ι

link of the chain. Ritter quotes Virg.

- Aen. 7. 49 ‘ tu sanguinis ultimus auctor.'

19. stetere. By the variation from ,
the usual ‘ exstitere,' Horace clearly
wishes to feel again something of a
living metaphor in the verb, though
it is not quite evident what the me-
taphor is. Cp. Virg. Aen. ν7. 553
‘stant belli causae.’ There it seems
to be ‘ they are on foot, in full life and
strength, there is no need to use any
more efforts to arouse them.’ Here
perhaps the verb cannot *be altogether
separated from ‘ ultimae? ‘ They have
been the pn‘mary and sufficient cause‚'
that which stands of its own strength,
leans on no other.

20. imprimeret muris aratum, to
plough the site of a conquered city was
a token (or a metaphor) of its total de-
struction. Prop. 4. 9. 41 ‘ Moenia cum
Graio Neptunia pressit aratro Victor
Palladiae ligneus artis equus) Cp.
Aesch. Ag. 526.

22. me quoque, as well as the rest
of the world, as it may you. Take care
