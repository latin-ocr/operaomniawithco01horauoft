LIB. IV. OD. 11.

Sordidum flammae trepidant rotantes
Vertice fumum. ¹

Ut tamen noris quibus advoceris

Gaudiis, Idus tibi sunt agendae,

’ Luce Maecenas meus adfluentes
Ordinat annos. -

Dives et lasciva tenetque grata
Compede vinctum.

, Spes, et exemplum grave praebet ales

Pegasus terrenum equitem gravatus
Bellerophontem,

Semper ut te digna sequare et ultra

Quam licet sperare nefas putando

Disparem vites. Age iam, meorum
Finis amorum—-
