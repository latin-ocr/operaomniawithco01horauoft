214 HORATII CARMINUM

Hic dies were mihi festus atras

Eximet curas3 ego nec tumultum

Nec mori per vim metuam tenente
Caesare terras. ¹

1·‚ pete unguentum, puer, et coronas

Et cadum Marsi memorem duelli,

Spartacum si qua potuit vagantem
Fallere testa.

Dic et argutae properet Neaerae

Murrheum nodo cohibere crinem;

Si per invisum mora ianitorem
Fiet, abito.

Lenit albescens animos capillus
Litium et rixae cupidos protervae3
. Non ego hoc ferrem calidus iuventa

Consule Planco.

(the reading of B) stands ιιι their pre- old; see on 3. 8.12. Juvenas‘s Calca-

sent text. It seems to be true, as Bent-
ley argues, that no other instance can be
quoted of a hiatus between a short and
a long vowel when there is no natural
break in the line (unless we retain
and argue upon the generally abandoned
reading ‘horribilesque ultimosque Bri-
tannosg’ of Catull. 11. 11), and such
compounds as‘ suaveolens? ⁴,graveolens'

etc., usually lose the ‘ e' in scansion. On
the other hand, while the temptation
would be strong to remedy an obvious
blot, and the insertion of ⁴ n’ would easily

suggest itself, we lack any authority for
the use of ‘nominatis’ in any appro-
priate sense. Of professed conjectures,
Bentley's ‘ inominatis’ is the most plaus-
1ble. In that case ‘male' must mean
with evil effect‚’ like ⁶ fraude mala,’ od.
1. 3. 28.

14. eximet,⁴ banish?

15 mori metuam, not in the sense
of 3. 9.11‚ but in the less usual sense
of‘ ne moriar metuam] With the
sentiment cp.4. 1517 foll. ⁶-Cus
tode rerum Caesare non furor Civilis:
etc.

18-20. ‘A cask of wine of the date
of the Max-sie or Social War(1³.c. 90-
88), if one has possibly (qua' 1s an abl„
as Virg. Aen. 1. 18¹ si qua fata sinant ')
oecaped the roving bands of Spastacus
(in the servile War fifteen years later).’
So the wine would be sixty- —three years

tamque tenet bellis Sociaiibus uvam: ,
5. 31, is most likely a reference to this
passage rather than a real date of wine ·
thch was drinkable' ιιι his time. Ritter
points* out that the reference to the suc· '
cession of civil wars has probably a
secondary purpose as heightening the ·
feeling of the last stanza, the peace and
security conferred on the world by
Caesar’ s rule.

19. spartacum, Epod. 16. 5. ·

21. arguta,- clear- voiced,' for she is
a singer.

22. mun-heum, fragant with myrrh-
Virg. Aen. 12. 1oo‘ crines . ,murrha
madentes?

cohibere minem, i. e. to adorn her- -
self for the purpose of coming to my
house; cp.a.11. 12. Thereisno need “
with Bentley and Meineke to make the
verbal resemblance more perfect by
reading ‘ cohibente.⁸

25. albescens3 as he calls himself
four years afterwards, ‘praecanum’Epp.
