the course which has been followed
lately by Macleane and Munro, sup-
ported by ‘the emphatic advocacy of
Dr. Kennedy: They put a full stop
at ‘nobilis,’ making ‘evehit’ the verb
of the new sentence, and ‘ hunc,' ‘illum '
the distribution of the collective accu—

sative ‘ terrarum dominos,’ in the sense
, ⁷ 'of ‘the Romans;’ see preceding note.
. The serious objection to this view lies

in the break of rhythm‚ resulting in an
anti-climax, caused by stopping at ‘ no-
bilis: The parallels which Mr. Munro
alleges. such as 1. 30. 5, quite dispose
of any difficulty which may have been
raised against the break in the fifth line

fi of the system, but they leave untouched

‘the poverty of ‘ palmaque nobilis ⁹ if it

Ι is the subject of the preceding verb, the

last in a series which descends both in

⁴. fulness of *sense and in weight of
· ἐοιιῐιᾶ.

“ 7. mobilium. The epithet, if it re-
flects the poet's own feeling (cp. Epp. 1.
19. 34 ‘ventosae plebis‚' Od. 3. 2. 20
‘popularis aurae ')‚ suits also the feel-
ing of the poem. It is the parallel of

’,ι the ‘dust’ of v. 3, the dangers of v. 24,
’ . ‘the discomforts of v. 25, etc.

⁴ Each
ursuit has its drawbacks, yet men fol-
ow it in spite of them.’
turba has a similar force, something
of Juvenal's ‘turba Remi: 10. 73. Cp.

tergeminis. ‘ Tergemini ' properly

⁹¹ ,meant ‘three born at a birth, as

‘gemini ' (Plaut. Amph. 1. 2. 18 ‘duos
geminos ’) by usage meant two so born.

9. 'proprio horrea· Cp. 3. 16. 26
‘ si quicquid arat impiger Apulus Occul-
tare meis dicerer horreis-² For other
metaphorical descriptions of the pas-
sion for enormous properties‚ which was
a characteristic of the age, see the latter
stanzas of that Ode, and 2. 2. 10 foll.

10. verritur, ‘ is swept together after
threshing.'

11. gaudentem, ⁴ one whose plea-
sure it is.’ The point of the following
lines is the tenacity with which men
cling to their own pursuit—so the in-
stance taken is no longer the lordly
owner osa ‘latifundium ¹ in the provinces,
but the humble cultivator of an ‘ avitus

findere sarculo. The verb and the
implement seem to imply difficult and.
personal work; a harsher soil as well
as a smaller farm. Contrast ⁶ scindere '
and ‘proscindere‚' used of ploughing‚
and compare Virg. G. 1. 94 ‘ rastris gle—
bas qui frangit inertes?

12. Attalicis condicionibuS, ‘ by
offers such as Attalus could make? An
allusion to the proverbial wealth os the
kings of Pergamus, see on Od. 2. 18. 5.
‘For the use of ‘ condicio: cp.- Cic. ad Q.
Fr. 1. 1. 2. 8 ‘ ut nulla condicio pecuniae
te . . ab summa integritate deduxerit?

13. cypria, Od. 3. 29. 60 ⁴ Cypriae
merces.’

14. Myrtoum. ‘Speciem pro genere

‚ponit more suo,’ Porph. on Od. 1, 16. 4.

So with ‘ Cypria,’ ‘ Icariis‚' etc. When
Horace puts a special for a general
designation in this manner he usually
selects a Greek one. F our names are
commonly assigned to different parts of
the Aegean: Thracium, the northern
part: Myrtoum, the western part, south -
of Euboea, so named from the small .
island Myrto, off the south coast of l
Euboea: Icarium, to the east of Myr-
toum, named from the island Icaria,
just west of Samos: Creticum (Od. Ι.
26. 2), south of both the last, washing
the island of Crete.
