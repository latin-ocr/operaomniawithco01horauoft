72 HORATII CARMINUM

O D E XXIII.

⁴ Yon fly from me, Chloe, like a frightened kid to its dam. 1 am not a tiger or
lion going to eat you. You are too old for such shyness?

Ι We have possibly part of a Greek original to this Ode in a fragment of

Anacreon (Fr. 51 Bergk) 2-

-aew ἀγανῶς οἷά τε νεβρὸν νεοθηλέα

γαλαθηνὸν ὅστ’ ἐν ὕλῃε κεροέσση*
ἀπολειφθεὶς ὑπὸ μητρὸε ἐπτοήθη.

Chloe’s name seems to be chosen to suit the character, see Introd. to i. 8 and

A . 1.

Quaerenti pavidam montibus aviis

Dimovere lacertae,
Et corde et genibus tremit.

the Comm. Cruq. and is found in one
MS. of the 10th century (π); but if it
be right, it was very early corrupted to

‘ vitat‚' which is read in B and all the
other 10th century MSS„ was interpreted
by Porph. and Acr., and is quoted by
Diomedes. A change from the third
person in v. 1 to the second in v. 9
would be strange in the absence of any

ξ on the other hand, a misunderstanding
ρ of the subj. of ⁴ tremit' may have led a
³ copyist to assimilate ‘vitas' to it. On
the metrical question, see on Od. 1. 15.

proaching there are no leaves nor
lizards nor fawns‚ and is displeased at
the boldness of attributing the shiver to
the approach of spring rather than to
the leaves, see 4. 4, 7. Muretus had
wn'tten (⁶ ex codd! but no extant MS. is
known to have it) ‘ Vitis inhorruit Ad

ing ⁴ vitis· to ‘ vepris,' a conj. which had . ⁸
