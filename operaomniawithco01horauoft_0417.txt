ΟΝ ΤΗΕ UNKNOWN NAMES IN THE ODES.

I'r is hardly necessary to read Estre’s summary of the many and
mutually destructive theories that have been proposed in order to
perceive the sutility of attempting to construet out of the Pyrrhas,
Lalages‚ Lydias of the Odes a history of Horace’s loves and dis-
appointments. Whatever foundation any Ode may have had in the
feelings or facts of the moment it is impossible now to distinguish
shadow from substance3 and there is much to indicate that Horace
did not wish it to be otherwise. Whatever be their origin, he treats
his love Odes as artistic studies. He arranges them not, we can feel
sure, in any chronological order as remembrances of his own life,
but where they will be most useful to relieve more serious poenis
or to stand side by side as companion pictures. We may see as
much as this from the nature of the names which he employs,
A certain number owe their selection obviously to their etymological
meaning, such as Pyrrha in 1. 5, Chloe in 1. 23, Lyce in 3. 10, Phi-

dyle in 3. 23 (cp. Sybaris in· 1. 8 ; the list may possibly be extended ·

by the names of Lalage in 1. 22, Leuconoe in 1. 11, and of Telephus
1. 13, etc. Horace is fond of playing on the meaning of names,
‘Glycerae immitis,’ 1. 33. 2, ‘Bibuli consulis amphoram,' 3. 28, 8,
‘Dulci Lyaeo solvere‚’ Epod. 9. 38). Some more are suspiciously
well adapted to the metre of the special poem 3 Leuconoe has this
reason at any rate for her existence, so has ‘Asterie' in 3. 7, and
‘Neobule' (cp. the name of her lover, ‘Liparaeus Hebrus') in the
Ionic a minore metre of 3. 12. With one or two exceptions the
unknown male names in the Odes (the names of Horace’s rivals,
as in 1. 13, on any theory of a real Lydia) are Greek names, Tele-
phus, Gyges, Calais; mythological names; sometimes the names of
Greek rivers, Hebrus 3. 12, Enipeus 3. 7. We may add perhaps
that where the designation is most full a‘nd precise we seem to see
most definitely the purpose of giving momentary substance to an
acknowledged shad0w3 see on ‘Thurini Calais filius Ornyti' 3.9. 14, ani
cp. Introd. to 2. 4. In a few cases we seem to see the appropriation
