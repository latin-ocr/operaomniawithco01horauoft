LIB. Ν. oD. 7. 289
Gratia cum *Nymphis geminisque sororibus audet 5
’ Ducere nuda choros. “
Immortalia ne speres, monet annus et almum
Quae rapit hora diem.
Frigorab'mitescunt Zephyris, ‚ver proterit aestas
Interitura, simul “
Pomifer Auctumnus fruges effuderit, et mox
Bruma recurrit iners.
Damna tamen celeres reparant caelestia lunae:
Nos, ubi decidimus,
Quo pater Aeneas, quo dives Tullus et Ancus, “ ¹5
Pulvis et umbra sumus.
Quis scit, an adiiciant hodiernae crastina summae
Tempora di superi?
Cuncta manus avidas fugient heredis, amico
Quae dederis animo. · 20

5. Gratia. oum geminis sororibus,
i. e. the three Graces. For the form cp.

3· ;.99.I116nus et, . . diem, the revolution.

of the year, and the rapidity with which
sunny days fly past us. ‘ Hora,' not so
much the evening hour (which would
be to introduce a new image) as the
flight os time, the passing hours. ,Cp. 2.
16. 32. It is not night3 but winter
which he sees approaching.

9. Compare the procession of the
seasons in Lucr. 5. 736.

proterit, καταπατεΐ, ⁶ tramples before
it‚’ of the advance of a victorious army;

11. effuderit, ‘has scattered broad-
cast! .

13. danma caelestia, ‘all that is lost

Ξ in heaven‘: primarily of the waning of

the moon itself, ‘damna' being eom-
monly used in this sense by Manilius

ι, 2 and others; but we are to understand

also the whole waste and damage of
the year as it passes back into winter.
With the whole thought cp. Catuli. 5. 5
‘ Soles occidere et redire possunt: Nobis
quum semel occidit brevis lux Nox -est
perpetua una dormienda.† '

15. pater. .The reading of V, though
a majority of MSS. read ‘pius' As
the more habitual Virgilian epithet, the
latter is the more likely to have been
substituted. The MSS. also vary be-

tween the ‘order ‘ Tullus dives' and
‘ dives Tullus.’ The epithet is intended,
probably. for both kings, princely wealth
being part of the traditions of the mon-

* archy. The general expression (cp.Epp. ἱ ·

U

1. 6. ²7 ‘Ire tamen restat. Numa quo
devenit et Ancus') is after Lucr. 3. 1037
‘Lumina sis oculis etiam bonus Ancus
reliquit,' that being from EnniusAnn. 1 50.

16. pulvis et umbra, the eonjunction
perhaps from SophAEl. 1158 ἀντὶ φιλ-

τάτης μορφῆς σποδόν τε καὶ σκιὰν dim-⁷ , “

φελῆ.

17. adiiciant, ‘may be adding? in
their counsels. .

hodiernae summae, ‘the total of our
days, as it stands to-day.’ The Bland.
V. (cp. the last Ode, v. 21) has, this
time in company with several other MSS,
⁸ vitae’ instead of ⁴ summae,⁷ which can

hardly be anything but a gloss. For Ι

‘ summae* in this connection cp. 1. 4. 1 5.

19. manus avidas heredis. New-
man remarks on this and similar expres-
sions (as z. 3. 20, 2. ¹4· 25), that the
state of feeling which they indicate he-
longs to the bachelorhood of the wealthy
Romans. ‘Amico dare animo’ is appa-
rently a translation of φὶλῃ ψυχῇ χαρί-
ζεσθαι -- ‘ genio indulgere ⁷ ; Simonides.
ξ 85, enforcing the same lesson from
the shortness of life, σὺ ταῦτα μαθὼν
βιότου ποτὶ τέρμα Ψυχῇ τῶν ἀγαθῶν
τλῆθι χαριζόμενος.
