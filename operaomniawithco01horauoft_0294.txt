HORATII CARMINUM

Plerumque gratae divitibus vices
Mundaeque parvo sub lare pauperum
Coenae sine aulaeis et ostro rs
Sollicitam explicuere frontem.
Iam clarus occultum Andromedae pater
Ostendit ignem, iam Procyon furit
Et stella vesani Leonis, .

Sole dies referente siccos: 20
Iam pastor umbras cum grege languido
Rivumque fessus quaerit et horridi

Dumeta Silvani, caretque
Ripa vagis taciturna ventis.
Tu, civitatem quis deceat status, γ ².⁵
curas, et Urbi sollicitus times,
Quid Seres et regnata Cyro
Bactra parent Tanaisque discors.

the elements which, Horace would say,
make up that ‘happiness ’ of Rome
which as a whole Maecenas is supposed
to admire. The point is the mixture of
magnificence and annoyance; but Horace,
as he indicates by the collocation, would
coun't the magnificence among the
annoyanees. For ⁶ strepitum ' cp. Epp.
2. 2. 72 oll.

13. vices, a change of lise.

14. mundae, the meaning of the
adjective is well defined in Sat. 2. 2. 65
⁴ Mundus erit qua non offendat sordibus
atque In neutram partem cultus miser?
gp. Pyrrha in Od. 1. 5. 5 ‘simplex mun-

mis.'

15. aulaeis. These are explained to
be an awning between the roos and the
table. At N asidienus' supper they fall
and bring down the aeeumulated dust
with them on the table; Sat. 2. 8. 54.
Cp. Virg. Aen. 1. 697 with Conington’s
note.

osta-03 ib. 700 ⁴ stratoque super
discumbitur ostro,’ of the purple eover-
ings of the couches.

16. explicuer03 Sat. 2. 2. 125 ‘Ex-
plicuit vino contractae seria frontis?
The tense is regular, ‘ have often ere
now,' etc. As Madvig points out (Opusc.
Acad. 2, p. 1 14), the so-ealled ‘ aoristic‘
use of the perfect is its use without
‘ plerumque ’ (which is present here) or
some word of similar generalising force,

 

as though such a word had been present:
see Od. 1. 34. 16.

12. clarus is predicative, ‘shows V

brightly the fire he had hidden before?

Andromedae pater, Cepheus. Ac-
cording to Columella, this constellation
rose in the evening on July 9.

18. Procyon, in Latin ‘Anteeanem‘
or ‘ Antemnis’ (Cic. N. D. 2.
sometimes ‘Canicula‚’ the Little Dog‚
which, on the ,same authoritys rose in
the morning on July 15. “

19. stella Leonis. The Lion. the
sign of the Zodiac‚ into which the sun
passed on Aug. 11C0lumeL 11. 2, 5 51.
The loose use of ‘ stella’ for a constella-
tion is found in Virgil also, asfi. 1. 222.

22. horridi=‘ hirsuti? The epithet
serves to recall his image, and perhaps
also to suggest the depth of the forest
‘ where the “uncouth” inhuman wood-
god lives?

25. statum cp. Cicero’s division,
Mur. 11 ‘ omnia quae sunt inimpeno et
in statu civitatis‚' almost=foreign and
home politics.

27. ὅθι-ους soe on 1. 12. 56.

regnata. cyro Baetra, for construe·
tion cp. 2. 6. 11 ‘regnata laconi rura
Phalanto.' ‘ Baetra’ is used sor the
Parthian empire. as are ‘Persia’ and
⁴ Media ’; ‘Cyro’ asz. 2. 17 ‘Cyri solio?

28. Tanais diaconi The Tanais .
