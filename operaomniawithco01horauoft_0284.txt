242 “ HORATII CARMINUM ’

Ο D E XXVI.

Tmz poet professes himself foiled in his addsesses to Chloe, and recognises the .
meaning os the failure: ‘ He has made his conquests in his time; but his campaigns
are over. Here in Venus' temple he will hang up the instruments of gallantry for

which he has no more use. May Venus (we expect, ‘grant him peace at last‚’
⁴ spare him further love troubles ') make Chloe' feel one little smart of her lash.' r

The conclusion points the irony of the beginning. Compare 4. 1. Introd.
On the position of the Ode see Introd. to Books i-iii‚ ξ 11. 1.
