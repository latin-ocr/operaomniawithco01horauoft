wives generally, is clear from the men- ν
tion of Augustus' sister in v. 7.
6. operata, probably to be taken as

1. Herculis ritu, a favourite mythi-
cal prototype of Augustus; cp. 3. 3. 9,
ἍῙΞάἒξ ἔιίιϊῐιιιιιΑἳᾘΙιῗιὴὸοέὒίνίἿῗε x2}th ’

here there is special reference to Her-
cules' jougney to Spain after the oxen of
Geryones.

» modo. Umorte ‘a moment ago our
'thoughts were all on the danger of his
expedition, now they are on the triumph ,

of his return.

plebs. No exact parallel is quoted
for this use of‘ plebs’ for the whole
Roman people with no tinge of the old
eontemptuous tone. There are plenty
of passages which show that a Roman
could use “populus and ‘’plebs at this

time without any feeling os the old dis· '.

tinction (cp. 2. 2.18‘Dissidens plebi
numero beatorum Eximit virtus, popu-
lumque falsis Dedocet uti Vocibus), but
they rather lower‘ populus’ to a level
with ‘plebs' as a synonym for the
‘'many when contrasted with the‘ few
whether of wealth, birth, or intellect.

2. morte venalem. Macleane well
quotes Aesch. in CteS. ξ 160 αἵματός
ἐστιν ἡ ἀρετὴ ὢνίας ‘’morte meaning
here, as αἵματος there, not necessaiily
the shedding of one' s blood, but the risk
of shedding it. cp. ‘montemque volunt

. pro laude pacisci,' Virg. Aen. 5. 230.
5. unico gaudens marito, ‘whose-

hole' Joy is in her husband‘; so Orelli,
ἕ though in identisying Livia the poet

'¹ 4 , intended to compliment her as a Roman

matron of the old type of conjugal
lqulty. He objects to Ritter’ s render-
ing of: ‘unicd' as=‘ egregio, ’that this

epit& ‘clari ducis? That the
erence to Livia, not to faithful

‘solata’ inVirg. G. 1. 293 (see Coning-
ton's note) as a present participle,

‘come forth and sacrifice.' For ‘ ope—
rari ’ in this technical sense, like ⁴ facere‚’
ῥέζειν, cp. Virg. G. 1. 339 ‘ Sacra refer
Cereri laetis operatus in herbis.’

div-is. This was the reading of ,
Aer. and Porph„ who interpret‘ iustis 2
divis,’ se. ‘qui Caesari victoriam et
reditum merenti dederunt? The balance
of older MSS. is in favour of samis:
which Orelli and Ritter retain. Bentley ·
shows that both constructions of‘ ope g
rari' are equally legitimate. ‘Iustis ᾖ
sacris' would mean ‘duly performed? “
and, if we take‘ unico gaudens marito’
with Orelli, must be connected with
those words; ·mulier pudica atque
igitur propter ipsam castimoniam digna
quae votum pro reditu mariti solvat
sacris iustis, sc. legitimis? ·

8. supplice νίκας Virg. Aen. 4. 637

‘ipsa pia tege tempora vitta.' This
seems distinct from its ordinary use, by
freeborn maids and matrons, to confine
the hair.

9, 10. virginum . . puellae, of young
wives, cp. 2. 8. 22, 3. 22. 2. The ma-
trons are bidden assist Livia and Octavia
in the religious rites. The retumin'g
soldiers and—the young wives to whom
they are returning are bidden εὐφημεῖν,
to keep a sacred silence, or not to inter-
rupt the ceremony by too noisy delight.

11. male ominatis, δυσφήμοιε. This
was the reading of V, and apparently of
the original text which Aer. and Porph.
interpreted (‘ ne incaute loquentes verbis
omina facerent ⁹), although ‘nominatis’
