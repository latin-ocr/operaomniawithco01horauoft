no'te of the stanza; it heightens our idea
of his power, and describes its nature.
The construction is, ‘qui temperat ter-

justice, the inconsisteney between this

His object now is to exalt Pallas, the

unshaken.

under the regular use (which he distin-
guishes in hisOpusc. Academ. a. 1 19), in
cases where there is definite reference to
a completed action. The object in view
was not only to place Pelion on Olym-
pus, but to leave it standing there. This
reference is clear in the old use of the
perf. inf. after ‘ volo’ in prohibitions

conj. in direct prohibition. This, and
not any aoristiq use, seems to be the
explanationes ‘ ne libeat iacuisse‚’ in

ment of the mountains (omitting Ossa),

which Virgil had inverted. But in so

doing he has left the epithet with what,
in his arrangement, is the least appro-
priate substantive. In Homer and
virgil, the ⁸ nodding woods ’ on the top

suggest queenly dignity and poetic
grace.
