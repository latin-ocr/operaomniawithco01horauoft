HORATII CARMINUM

Vivet extento Proculeius aevo, 5
Notus in fratres animi paterni3
Illum aget penna metuente solvi
Fama superstes.
Latius regnes avidum domando
Spiritum, quam si Libyam remotis ιο

handling (λάμπει ’γὰρ ἐν χρείαισιν ὥσπερ
ἐκπρεπὴς χάλκος, Soph. Fr. 742, quoted
by Ritter); secondarily and metaphori-
cally, to the right use of money. In the
epithet ⁴ temperato,’ on the' contrary, the
moral sense is the predominant one.
5—8. An instance of the wisely directed
use of which he speaks. Acron's note
is, ⁶ Proculeius qui pius sic erga fratres
suos Scipionem et Murenam fuit ut cum
spoliatis bello civili patrimonium suum
de integro divideret‚' in which ⁴ Scipio-

{nem' has been ingeniously altered by
ς Estre' to ‘ Caepionem‚’ the name of the
:¹ person who suffered with Murena for a
; conspiracy against Augustus in B.c. 22.
ᾖ There is no reason, however, from any
⁴ other authority, to suppose that the two
were brothers. It may perhaps be
2' doubted whether Horace's words neces-
. sarily imply that Proculeius had more

than one brother: the plural generalises.
That he was the brother (or cousin, for
this doubt always besets the words
‘ frater’ and ἀδελφός) of Murena (od. 3.
19. 11,’ Sat. 1. 5. 38), the ‘ Licinius ¹ of
Od. 2. 10, and the brother of Maecenas’
wife Terentia, we know from Dio 54. 3.
Proculeius was high in Augustus' favour3
so much so, that he is named as one of
the persons to whom at different times
the emperor had thought of marrying
his daughter Julia (Tac. Ann. 4. 40).
Juvenal (7. 94) couples him with Mae-
cenas as a patron of literature.

5. vivet extento aevo, ‘shall live
beyond the term of life? Cp. Virg. Aen.
10. 468 ‘breve et irreparabile tempus
Omnibus est vitae; sed famam eittendere
factis Hoc virtutis opus.’

6. notus animi, cp. probably the
same construction Od. 4. 13. 21 ‘nota
artium.' Horace uses the Greek gen.
of relation to avoid the awkwardness of

4. 2] ‘paternus 111 pueros animus Nero4-
1185.

7. aget, ⁶ will carry on his way,' will
not allow him to fall, as he ‘volitat
vivus per ora virum.' The weight os

against ⁴ agitJ'an‘d'it is preferable also
35 suiting better with ⁶ vivet? and as
not implying‚ what there is no reason
otherwise to suppose, that Proculeius
was‘dead at this time.

metuente solvi, ‘that dare not droop,’
‘is shy of drooping.² Od. 3. 11. 10, 4.
5. 20. virgil had the expression first,
G. 1. 246 ‘Arctos metuentes aequore
tin '.'

§dlvss like Virgil’s ‘solvi membra,'
λύεσθαις 01 possibly, as Ritter suggests,
with a ‚remembrance of Icarus fate,
whose wings were fastened with wax and
melted in the sun. Cp. 111 3 511111131·
metaphorical description of posthumous ’
fame, ‘ Daedaleo notior Icaro,' Od. 2.
20. 13.

9. latius regnes. In the following
stanzas Horace is thinking of the Stoic
paradox, that the wise man is king.
Cp. Sat. 1. 3. 125, 136, Epp. 1. 1. 107,
etc.. Sen. Thyest. 334 foll. ‘ Regem non
faciunt opes‚' etc.

10—1 2. ⁶ Than if your property stretch-
ed into the far South and Waet, so as to
unite in one sway Carthage and its
Spanish colonies! Gades was one of
these: see Cic. pro Balbo 14, Liv. 28.
87. The expression should be compared
with Od. 3. 16. 31,41 ‘F ulgentem imperio
fertilis Africae,’ ‘ Mygdoniis regnum
Alyattei Campis continuem! Horace is
not speaking in either case of proconsul-
ships, but os the ‘latifundia’ (see on
Od. 1. 1. 9). which were one of the
favourite 'means of investing and acquir-
ing wealth. Seneca expands this as other
Horatian metaphors, Epp. 89 ‘ Hoc
quoque parvum' est nisi latifundiis ves-
tris maria cinxistis: nisi trans Hadriam
et Ionium Aegaeumque vester villicus
regnet . . sit fundus quod aliquando im-
perium vocabatur.’ In both passages of
Horace the metaphor of royalty is sug-
gested by the context—here by ‘latius
regnes’ and the allusion to Phraates,
in 3. 16 by ‘dominus splendidior' and
⁶ vectigalia? ’
