364 HORATII EPODON

EPODE XVI.

‘A secono generation is passing away in civil war. Roman hands are doing γ

what no foeman, in Italy or beyond it, has been able to do. The site of Rome
‘wiu be once more desolate; barbarian conquerors will ride over it, and scatter
with their horse-hoofs the bones of Romulus. Do you ask the remedy? Let us
fly like Qve hearth and home, and fly—anywhere3 only never to
come bac again till stone swims and every law of nature is changed. Let us all
go—all, or all that have men's hearts in them. We shall find a home beyond the
Ocean. There are the Happy Islands‚ where the earth yields its fruit without

labour‚ where the powers of nature never injure, where commerce has never come
to taint man, nor plague to taint cattle. Jove set them apart for the good when he

turned the golden age to bronze—to bronze and then to iron. It is time for'those >

who are good to seek the offered refuge.’

See Introd. to Epod. 7. The two poems belong to the same phase os feeling.
They may have been written at any time when Horace had begun to sicken of the
aimless bloodshed of the civil war, and before he had seen or reconciled himself to

the practical remedy which Octavianus offered for it. At present‘the suggestion ι

of a mode of escape from it is not more than a poetical mode of expraesmg its
hopelessness. He cannot see its issue, any more than in Epod. 7 he oen see its
causes.

The Pseudo-Acron quotes from a lost work of Sallust, to the effect that Sertorius,
after his defeat, thought of sailing into the Atlantic in search of the fabled islands
of the blest, ‘ad insulas Fortunatas voluisse ire.' The genuineness of the quotation
is confirmed by Servius, who, on Virg. Aen. 5. 735, refers to Sallust as having
spoken os the μακάρων νῆσοι. Plutarch tells the same story in the life of Sertorius,
ch. 9. It is very possible that Horace may have heard it, and that it may have
suggested the conclusion of the Epode. Δ

Compare the description of the Happy Islands both in thought and expression
with Virgil’s Golden Age in Ecl. 4.
