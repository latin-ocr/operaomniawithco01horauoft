H ORATII CARMINUM ι

Seu rixam et insanos amores
Seu facilem, pia testa, somnum,
Quocunque lectum nomine Massicum 5
Semas, moveri digna'b'cssffo die,
Descende, Corvino iubente
Promere languidiora vina.
Non ille, quamquam Socraticis madet
Sermonibus, te negleget horridus: , ιο
Narratur et prmnis
Saepe mero caluisse virtus.
Tu lene tormentum ingenio admoves

Plerumque duro ;

Fervidiom mero arcana promorat 1000.’

The two pairs seem to be (1) of talk,
the outpouring of passionate complaints
or of mirth; (5) of seelings, bitterness or
passion on the one side, pmceful slumber
on the other.

4. pia testa, ‘gentle wine—jar! The
epithet apologises for the calumnious
suppositions; contrast ‘impius clamor,’
1. 27. 6, and the tone of1. 18.

5. quocunque 1101111110, *10 whatever

oeding suppositions)‘ the Massic grapes

for a ‘‚ground’ ‘purposess ‘tendency.'

9. uiadet= ‘imbutus est’: butas Mr.

’ 111 sapientium

is a play on the literal and meta hon-ieal
meaning. The sponge is so fu of phi-
losophy, that there might be supposed
to be 110 100111 for the wine.

10. sermonibus, not merely the
Dialogues of Plato and others 111 which
