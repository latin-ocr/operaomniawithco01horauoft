HORATH CARMINUM

Lenesque sub noctem susurri
Composita repetantur hora, κο
Nunc et latentis proditor intimo
Gratus puellae risus ab angulo
Pignusque dereptum lacertis ’
Aut digito male pertinaci.

20. composita, ‘the hour of tryst’;
Juv. 3. 16 ‘ubi nocturnae Numa consti-
tuebat amicae.’

21 foll. ⁶ Now too the sweet tell-tale
laugh srom the secret corner that be-
trays the hiding girl'; ‘repetatur' is
understood from the last sentence.
Compare the lover's play in Virg. E. 3.
63 ‘ Et fugit ad salices et se cupit ante
videri! Dillenburger calls attention to

the symmetrical arrangement of the ad-
jectives and their substantives: ‘latentis
puellae,’ ‘proditor risus,’ ‘intimo an-
gulo’; ‘puellae' seems to depend ἀπὸ
κοινοῦ on ‘ proditor’ and ‘ risus.'

24. male pertinaci. This may
mean either ‘but faintly resisting' or
‘wickedly (i. e. coquettishly) resisting,’
resisting in order to invite the vio-
leuce.

mentions a hymn to Hermes by Alcaeus. and that it contained the story of his
thest of the oxen. Among the fragments of his poetry (Fr. 3 Bergk) there is
what seems to be ‘the first line of a Sapphic Ode to Hermes :- ⁹

a The Ode is a study, and doubtless an imitation, not a translation, from Greek.

Mercurius, identified with the Greek Hermes, is celebrated as the teacher of Ἴ

language; of the palaestra; of the lyre; of craft, theft included3 as the herald,

πομπαῖος, on earth and below it.

Compare Ovid, Fast. 5. 66 3-692 ‘Clare nepos Atlantis,’ etc.

MERCUR1‚ facunde nepos Atlantis,
Qui feros cultus hominum recentum
Voce formasti catus et decorae

1. facunde, λόγιος is a frequent
epithet of Hermes; so he is the
rssouthpiece of the gods, ‘interpres

worn!

nepos, as the son of Maia ‘quam
Atlas ‘generat,' Virg. Aen. 8. 141.

3. voce formasti, comp. Horace's

account of man before the invention os ’Ἠ
