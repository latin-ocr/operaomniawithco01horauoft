Mugiunt vaccae, tibi tollit hinnitum

Apta quadrigis equa, te ‘bis Afro 35

hour if not another: cp. 4. 7. 8. Ritter
takes ‘ tibi quod' negarit ’ of life, as
though it meant ‘ Ι may perhaps survive
you.’ But a more general sentiment is

= a better introduction to the next two

stanzas; and it is the broad equality of¹
men's lots that is in point, so that
⁸ mihi porriget tibi quod negarit ’ would
seem naturally to imply the converse
also, that Grosphus will have what
Ho-race has not.

33. Grosphus has large pastures in
Sicily. For this form of wealth‘see on
1. 31. 5. Cp. Epod. 1. 27, Epp. 2. 2. 117.

33, 34. greges. ,mugiunt. If greges'

'⁷ · is to be distinguished from‘ vaccae?

according to the common opposition of
‘greges et armenta‚’ ‘flocks and herds,’
there is an easy zeugma in the use of
‘mugiunt. ’ Possibly, however‚‘ greges
vaccaeque' = ‘greges vaccarum’ (cp.
, Epod. 2. ιι ‘mugientium gregesss) the
two being separated in order to give
more emphasis to the numeral and ad-
ective.

38. spiritum Camenae, equivalent,
as the commentators say, to the ἴσα
πνεῖν Μούσαις of the epigram on Sappho
(Anal. Brunck. p. 449) save that‘ spirare’
and‘ spiritus' have a special reference,
which we do not know' ιιι πνεῖν, to the

‘thoughts that breathe and words that
burn’ of poetry. Cp. Od. 4 3. 24
‘Quod spiro et placeo, si placeo, tuum
est? 4. 6. 29‘ Spiritum Phoebus mihi,

’ Phoebus artem Carminis nomenque

dedit poetae? See also Sat. 1. 4. 42 -47,
where the name of poet is limited to the
man, ‘Ingenium cui sit, cui mens divi-
pior atque os Magna sonaturuml and it
⁷ is doubted whether comedy can claim

to be poetry, ‘ quod acer spiritus ac vis
Nec verbis nec rebus inest.’

tenuem has no doubt a close relation
to ‘Graiae,’ and describes the polish
and refinement of taste which Horace
missed in the earlier Roman literature.
Cp. A. P. 323, where there is the same
antithesis as that hinted here between
the delicacy of literary taste and the
coarser Roman life with its love of
wealth‚ ‘Graiis ingenium) etc. It is
difficult to say how much feeling of the

-metaphor remains in either‘ spiritum’

or‘ tenuem? If 'this passage stood alone
we should have no difficulty in ir ter-

preting ‘'tenuem of the fineness and
delicacy of the air, but‘ tenuis* like
the Gr. λεπτός and corresponding w οι(15
in many languages, is used widely of
nicety of judgment or taste or expres-
sion. Horace gives it in this sense
another metaphorical connection, ΕΡΡ.
2. 1. 225 ‘tenui deducta poemato filo.'

The rival interpretation of‘ tenuem
spiritum' as= ‘particulam aliquam exi-
guam spiritus’ is not so good. Ho-

race’s sarm is ‘Jsmall but we do not
want to continue the depreciation of his
lot, but to enforce the doctrine of the
fair balancing of fortune by contrasting
his modest external means with the
richness of his mental gifts.

Camenae, used without scruple of the
Greek Μοῦσαι. Cp.‘
menae, 'Od. 4. 9. 8.

39. non mendax dedit, Carm. S. 25

sig ned to me that lot in days gone by,
and she has kept her word? “
