⁸ tradiditffiwould be, as Bentley shows,
the more usual verb. The ‘perfidy’ of
the foes to whom he surrenders is in
point, both as showing by a 'side touch
the folly of his cowardice‚ and also, like
the ‘ closeness’of the toils, as contri-
buting to unman the soldier who has
once been in their power. x Ι

timuitque mortem. Bentley con-
nects these words with the following
stanza‚ and reads ‘- timuitque mortem
Hinc unde vitam sumeret aptius, Pacem
et duello miscuit‚’ i. e. ‘ has shrunk from
the sword, which to a brave man is the
security of life, as though it were only
an implement of death.’ ‘Aptius’ is
found in several MSS, and som‘e of
value, but there is no trace of the other
alterations, ‘ hinc,’ 'et‚{ which it seems
to necessitate. ‘ Inscius ' is found in the
great majority of MSS, and was read
by all the Scholiasts‚ one of whom in-
terprets ‘qui nesciret vitam viro sorti
potius de armis sperandum.' Bentley
’ objects to the vulg, that the last charge

‘timuitque mortem’ involves ‘ minorem

culpam quam ea quae praecesserant?
But it is quite in the old Roman spirit

to sum up the baseness of the captives ’

in the charge that they ‘feared death!

sumeret. The subjunctive has to do
double duty; for that mood would be
required if it were merely the indireet
question, ‘ignorant whence he drew';
but it has a further potQitial force, ‘ igno-
rant whence he might draw,' ‘would
draw if he tried!

38. pacem duello miscuit, ⁴ has for-
gotten the difference between peace and
war’; in the latter ¹safety is to be won
only by the sword.

40. altior ruinis, ‘lifted higher (in

appearance—relative height) by the fall
of Italy.’ This is simpler than ‘ tower-
ing over‚' as Orelli takes it.
Α 41. fertur. Cp.3. 20.12:it is the com-
mon formula when the narrator would
throw the responsibility of his narrative
on hearsay or tradition. Possibly here
it is intended to call a momentary
attention to the contrast between the
spirit of Regulus and the spirit of mo-
dern Rome. ⁶ strange as it sounds, they
tell us!

form of ‘ capite deminutus‘; the genitive
after the analogy of ‘integer vitae.'
