had meant to say, ‘ You are a great man at Formiae at least. in the home os your
heroic ancestor.' He professes to foresee a rainy day. and bids Lamia use the
dry weather to house his wood and prepare for to-morrow's festival. The eonnec-
tion of thought we may compare with 1. 9. That Ode will show that it is not

necessary, from the mention of the sea, to suppose that Lamia was at Formiae. ·

In both probably the stormy weather, if not actually allegorical, is used to enforce
a moral beyond that which appears on the surface. The one other certain refer-
ence to Lamia in Horace⁹s poems (Od. 1. 26), and another probable one (Ep. 1.

14. 6), suggest to us that he was a man before whom his friend would desire to set
the sunny side of life. ’

Vv. 2-5 have been condemned by many critics with no support from external
evidence; but the Introduction which their omission would leave would not be

more free from difficulties than the unmutilated one. Peerlkamp more consistently
condemns the Ode.
