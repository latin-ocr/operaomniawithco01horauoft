HORATII CARMINUM

Acron’s statement, ‘Stesichorum imitatur: can barely mean more than that

Horace took from him the idea of a ‘ palinode.'

Ritter suggests that the first

line may be an echo of some line in which Stesichorus addressed Helen as fair-er

than her mother Leda.

O MATRE pulchra filia pulchrior,
Quem criminosis cunque voles modum
Pones iambis, sive flamma
Sive mari libet Hadriano.
Non Dindymene, non adytis quatit 5
Mentem sacerdotum incola Pythius,
Non Liber aeque, non acuta
Sic geminant Corybantes aera,
Tristes ut irae, quas neque Noricus

2. modum pones, ⁸ modum ponere‚’
‘ to set bounds‚' ‘ cupidinibus, orationi,'
etc.. are common expressions, cp. Od.
3. 15. 2 ‘ nequitiae fige modum.’ There
is a play in its extension here to mean
simply ⁶ to put an end to‚’ i. e. ‘ destmy!
The verses have been intemperate, the
lady shall put bounds to them in the
only possible way. Compare Ovid's
trope, ‘ Emendaturis ignibus: Trist.
. 10. 62.
4 3. ponae, the permissive future, ‘you
shall if you wish‚’ see on Od. 1. 6. 1.
4. Hadriano, see on Od. 1. 1. ¹4·
5—9. ‘ Ira furor brevis est! ¹ No di-
vine affiatus makes those it possesses so
reckless as the passion of anger!
5. Dindymene, ¹ Dea Dindymi,' Cat.
62. 91, a mountain in Phrygia where
5Cybele was worshipped.
J non adytis . . incola Pythius. 1t
ι’ seems best to take this as a slight inver-
Ι sion, aster Horace’s manner, for ‘ adytis
Pythiis incola,' ‘ not in his shrine at
Pytho the god who dwells there ’; comp.
Epod. 10. 12 ‘Graia victorum manus'
for the more usual ‘Graioruml For
the mode of describing the god, comp.
Virg. Aen.
belae.² Possibly ‘incola' may have a
-stronger force, and represent Pindar’s

3. 111 ‘ mater cultrix Cy-

! οὐκ ἀπόδαμοε τυχών (Pyth. 4. 7), ‘ when

his presence is there’ ; with reference to
, the migrations'TJTgods from one shrine
to' another. Dillenburger’s interpreta-
tion is less likely. He takes ‘ sacer-
dotum‚' ἀπὸ κοινοῦ,ινίῖ11 ‘ incola’ as well
as with ‘mentem,’ ‘his priests’ hearts
when he possesses themssqquoting Plu-

. clash again,' etc. His reading is

tarch de Orac. Des. p. 414 e, τὸν θεὸν
αὐτὸν . . ἐνδυόμενον εἰσ τὰ σώματα τῶν
προφητῶν ὑποφθέγγεσθαι.

“ adytis is opposed to the more widely
diffused afflatus, ἑνθουσιασμόε, of Cybele ,
or Bacchus.

7—8. non acuta sio . . nera, ⁸ the
Corybantes do not elash again their
ccgllxylzatllsieghltvlsiojdlgharfdlzffi a pirenthespis:
putting in another form what we have
already had of the priests of Cybele·
and the main construction hannon·
not with them but with the oth
clauses. ‘ Non Dindymene . . non Apoll
. . non Liber aeque quatiunt mentem .
tristes ut irae.’ Bentley, offended at th
anacoluthon, proposed to read ‘si’ fo χ
‘ sic: constructing as od. 2. 17. 13 ‘M t '

resurgat centimanus Gyas Divellet un·
‘ Not the Corybantes if th

cepted by Keller, Dillr„ and others. ἰ
but in addition to the fact that only the · ,
slightest MS. authority can be obtained
for it, there is the objection that it will
introduce an entirely new idea, viz. the
effect of the Corybantian cymbals on the Ἴ
hearers, instead of what we have in th ,Ι ,
rest of the stanza, the effect of the divin »
afflatus on the ἔνθεοι themselves: and
the second-hand inspiration will be th. .
weaker, the result is an anticlimax.
9. tristes, ⁶ ill-omened‚’ ‘ odiens!
irae, ‘ bursts of passion?
Noricus, Epod. 17. 71. Noricum, the
modern TyroL Styria, Carinthia, was
famous for its iron, Plin. N. H. 34. 41.
