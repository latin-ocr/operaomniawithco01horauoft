LIB. IV. OD. 15.. 313

Iniecit emovitque culpas
Et veteres revocavit artes,
Per quas Latinum nomen et Italae
Crevere vires famaque et imperi
Porrecta maiestas ad ortus 15
Solis ab Hesperio cubili.
Custode rerum ‘Caesare non furor
Civilis aut vis exiget otium,
Non ira, quae procudit-'enses
Et miseras inimicat urbes. 20
Non, qui profundum Danubium bibunt,

Edicta rumpent Iulia, non Getae,

and double gateway (Burn’s Rome, pp.
xxiv and 87), which was opened in time
of war and closed in time of peace, was
‘Ianus Quirinus‚’ ⁴ Quirinus ’ being ap-
parently an adjective, as in ‘Ianus Ge-
minus,' ⁶ Ianus Iunonius‚’ etc. It is open
therefore to suppose either that the geni-

· tive was used indifferently with the ad-

, jective as=‘ of Romulus’ (to-whom the

ilms‘Z-“WW‘QWYW' ξυμ-,- μ ,-

worship of Janus was attributed), ‘of
Rome‚’ ‘Romam’ or that Horace con-
sciously varies the usual form, as he
does technical expressions so often ς see
on 3. . 2.

10. {tgna licentiae iniecit3 3. 24. 29.

12. artem ⁶ Imperium facile his arti-
bus retinetur quibus initio partum est,’
Sathat. 2. 4. They a-re the virtues of
old Roman lise celebrated in 3. 1-6.
Fpr ‘artes' cp. 3. 3. 9 ‘ Hae arte Pollux,’
etc. As Kritz explains on the passage
in Sallust, the word only=‘studia ac
mores‚' and must draw its positive colour
frOm the context. We need not think,
with many of Horace's editors, of the
possible etymologica} connection of ‘ ars ’

*with ἀρετή. If the end proposed were

bad. ⁸ artes ’ would be Vlces.

14. imper-13 see on 1. 2. 26.

15. ortus. There is a v. 1. of less
authority, ἑ ortum.¹ It is a case clearly
where either singular or plural is admis—
sible‚ and where variety is quite a suffi-

‡ cient· motive to account for their inter-
, change. Bentley quotes Sall. Cat. 36

‘cum ad occasus ab ortu solis omnia

’ domita armis parerent.' ”

17. custod03 3. 14. 15, 4. 5. 1.

18. exiget, in its simple sense, ‘ drive
out,’ as 2. 13. 31⁷‘exactos tyrannos?
B has ‘exigit’3 V, unmetrically, ‘ exe-

git.’ Some form of the verb was eer-
tainly read by Porph., who interprets
‘excludet‚ quasi ἔξω agit, ut Terentius:
spectandae an exigendae.' There is good
MS. authority also for ⁶ eximet‚' which
is preferred by Rister, Keller, and Mr.
Mu-nro; and it is a common Horatian-
word, Od. 2. 2. 19, 3. 14. 14, Epp. 1. 5st
18, 2. 2. 212, though this is hardly an
argument for it here.

'20. miseras, proleptically, ‘to their
mlsery.' ”

inimicat, ‘ sets at variance‚’ a word,
apparently, as Porph. tells us (‘fictum
verbum est ’)‚ eoined by Horace.

21. For the form of expression see
on 3. 10. 1; cp. 2. 2. 20 ‘ Rhodani potor?
The peoples meant may be either the
Vindelici (4. 4. 18), against whom Tibe·-
rius had won some victories‚ or the
Daci (3. 6. 13‚Virg. G. 2. 497 f coniurato
descendens Dacus ab Istro'), who used
to be spoken of as dangerous in the
early years of Augustus’ reign.

22. edicta Iulia.. We must no more
look for a technical meaning in ‘ edicta‚’
than for exact historical facts to corres-
pond with the general statement. ⁶ Edic-
tum,’ though limited very much in use
to the praetor’s edicts‚ was a general

'term sor any command issued by a

magistrate. The form of the phrase is
intended to recall ‘leges Iuliae,‘ the name
which covered the domestic legislation
of Augustus as well as Julius. The
substance. so far as it had any which
can be realised‚ would be terms of
peace, which Augustus has imposed on
the various nations.
