ODE IV.

Tru-2 lesson of the Ode is the same, though not so explicitly put, as that of Od.
‘ We have spring once more, all nature

ἠ · is enjoying itself. Take thy fill of pleasure, Sestius, for death, which comes to
- rich and poor alike‚ will soon be here, and then no more pleasures.’

The Sestius to whom it is addressed is probably identified with L. Sestius, son
of the P. Sestius whom Cicero defended. He had served in M. Brutus’ army with

’Δ Horace. Dio C. 53. 32 mentions it to the credit of Augustus, that he appointed
. ,Sestius ‘Consul suffectus' in his own room in 1³.c. 23, although he was notorious
’ sor preserving images of Brutus, and honouring his memory.

The metre (Archilochium IVtum) is from Archilochus, Fr. 91 :—-

οὐκέθ’ ὁμῶς θάλλειε ἁπαλὸν χρόα· κάρφεται ’γὰρ ἤδη,
ὄγμος κακοῦ δὲ γήραος καθαιρεῖ.

SOLVITUR acris hiems grata vice veris et Favoni3
Trahuntque siccas machinae carinas ;

Ac neque iam stabulis gaudet pecus aut arator igni,
Nec prata canis albicant pruinis. ’

Iam Cytherea choros ducit Venus imminente Luna, 5 ⁷

 

1. solvitur, winter is a chain in

which the wolld is bound. ‘ Rura gelu . .
’.3 claudit hiems‚’ Virg. G. 2. 3¹73 cp. Od.
s 1. 9. 5 ‘dissolve frigus!

> grata viee, ‘the pleasant succession?

⁶³ Epod. 13. 7 ⁶ benigna vice! -
·· 2. machinae, ⁸ rollers‚’ such as thos

² described by Caesar, B. G. 2. 10 ‘hoc
opus omne . . machinatione navali pha-
langis subiectis ad turrim admovent.'

The meaning of ‘trahunt ’ is defined by
‘ siccas '; ‘ draw down to the sea the keels
long high and dry,' navigation having
been suspended during the winter.

5. Cytherea Venus. The conjunc-
tion of the two names is not found in
any other classical writer, cp. Od. 1. 17.
22 ‘Semeleius Thyoneus.' In the pro-
cession of the seasons, Lucret. 5. 736,
Venus is the companIOn of Spring, as
