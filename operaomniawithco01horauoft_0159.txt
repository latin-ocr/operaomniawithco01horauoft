Gadibus iungas et uterque Poenus
Serviat uni.
Crescit indulgens sibi dirus hydrops,
Nec sitim pellit, nisi causa morbi
Fugerit venis et aquosus albo 15
Corpore languor.
Redditum Cyri solio Phraaten ‚
Dissidens plebi numero beatorum
Eximit Virtus, populumque falsis
Dedocet uti 20
Vocibus, regnum et diadema tutum
Deferens uni propriamque laurum,
' Quisquis ingentes oculo inretorto
Spectat acervos.

11. et, ‘and s0.' Dillr. draws atten-
tion to the consecutive force of ‘ et,’ as
almost equal to ‘ita ut.' Cp. 1. 3. 8,
4. 13. 10.

13. indulgens sibi, ‘by indulging
itself: i. e. its own feverish thirst.

hydrops, ‘the dropsy.’ It is pro-
perly the subJect of ‘crescit‚’ but it is
made also the subject of ‘indulgens '
and ‘ pellit: the actions of the siek man
being attributed to his malady.

14. nec sitim . . languor, ‘drinking
increases the disease; it cannot quench
the thirst till the malady which causes
the thirst is gone, and with it the other
symptoms.’ The application of the
analogy is evident. Cp. 3. 16. 17 ‘Cre-
scentem sequitur cura pecuniam Maior-
Ovid reproduces the

deant plurima plura petunt: Sic quibus
intumuit suffusa ven ter ab unda Quo plus
sunt potae plus sitiuntur aquae.'

κ nisi . . venis. They speak of drink-
ing as though it immediately filled the
veins, Sat. 2. 4. ²5 ‘vacuis committere
venis Nil nisi lene decet‘ ς of thirst as

though it were felt in the veins, Virg. G
3. 482 ‘venis omnibus acta sitis? So
the meaning is, ‘no pouring into the
veins will cure the thirst; there is some-
thing that must be got rid of out of
them—some inner malady in the re-
cesses of the body!

15. aquosus languor, ‘ the faintness
caused by the water.’

17. redditum cyri solio, cp. 3. ²9·
27 ‘regnata Cyro Bactra.’ It is the most

distinct enunciation of that identity of ἶ

the Parthian with the Persian monarchy
which Horace assumes elsewhere. See
on Od. 1. 2. 22. For the historical event
referred to see Introd. to Books i-iii, ξ 8.

19. Virtus, the judgment of avirtuous
man, as in Sat. 1. 3. 4²· “

20. dedocet, ⁶ would fain unteach
the people to use names falsely.'

21, 22. tutum, propriam, predica-
tive, a diadem and a laurel crown that
cannot be taken away again: Cp. 3. 2.
1 —20.

⁷2 3. oculo inretorto, ⁸ who can see
huge treasure-heaps, and never turn to
look again!
