308 HORATII CARMINUM

Quid Marte posses. Milite narn tuo
Drusus Genaunos, implacidum genus, 10
Breunosque veloces et arces
Alpibus 'impositas tremendis
*Deiecit acer plus vice simplici3
Maior Neronum mox grave proelium
Commisit immanesque Raetos 15

Auspiciis pepulit secundis,
spectandus in certamine Martio,
Devota morti pectora liberae
Quantis fatigaret ruinis3
Indomitas prope. qualis undas 20
Exercet Auster, Pleiadum choro <
Scindente nubes, impiger hostium

9. milite tu03 cp. v. 33.

10. Genaunes, Breunos, two
tian tribes. The name of the first is
thought to be still traced in the Val di
N on. which runs N. W. from the valley
of the Adige at S. Michele‚ half-way be-
tween Trent and Botzen 3 the second in
the name of the Brenner Pass itself, and
the town of Brunecken.
Himplaeidum‚ a word not found before

orace.

11. veloces, moving swistly from
place to place.

i 3. deiecit, a word specially applic-
able to the forts built on the brink of
precipices (v, 12); so that it has here
something of the ‘effect >of a zeugma,
though it is a usual word sor ‘dislodging’
an enemy. Epp. 2. 2. 30.

plus vioe simplici. ‘ Quia dupla
quam dederant clade perculsi sunt‚’
Porph.‚ *with more than a bare requital
(“ vicem reddere ”),’ ‘with heavyinterest.'
It corresponds to ‘ sine clade,' v. 3².
Lambinus understood it as= ‘more than
once.’ ⁵ Plus '=‘ plusquam '; cp. 1. 13.
20 ‘ suprema citius die: ⁶ sooner than on
the last day.’

1'4. maior Neronum, Tiberius; see
Introd. to the Book.

17. spectandus . . quantis, θαυμα-
στὸς . . zeon, a brachylogy less common
in Latin than in Greek. For its ψει
in bringing the relative clause into
closer relation with the leading clause
we may compare 1. 33. 1 ⁴ doleas . . cur
praeniteat ’ς for the methea we may
compare v. 7 of this Ode, inasmuch as

Rhae-

the passive ‘ spectandus quantis? etc„
implies a possible active, ‘spectare ali·
quem quantis‚' etc. For the violation of
the usual caesura see Index of Metres.
18. devota. morti liberae=‘1ibere.’

they gave themselves sreely to death, ”

stood to be killed; or= ‘the death os
freemen‚’ death in preference to bond-
a e.

g19. ruinis, ‘shocks,’ as of an earth-

uake.

q 20. indomitas, ‘tameless.' The
simile is double: the freedom and ob-
stinacy of the waters‚ the fierce rushes
and persistence of the *south wind. We
need not press the epithet to a contra- x
diction, as Bentley’s too logical criticism
does, as though it would require that
Tiberius should not have conquered the

Raeti. He would read (and one MS.

- supports him) ‘indomitus’ The· simile

depends grammatically on what follows,
the construction being ‘qualis Auster
exercet undas [ita . . tali modo] impiger
hostium vexare turmas‚’ ,⁸ impiger,’ etc„
grammatically again, qualifying ‘fati-
aret.’
g 22. scindente nubes, ‘when they
shine through the torn clouds.’ The
{35333225‘51‘222‘252‘·¹.¹;2.3.*1²›²1{¹¹15.1:⁷:3.;

may be near either equinox; see Dict.
Ant. Pleiades, s. v. Astronomia), and of
stormy member, ⁸ when the sky is full of
broken clouds? Orelli takes ‘scindente'
pli their oplfning the clouds. i. e. letting
