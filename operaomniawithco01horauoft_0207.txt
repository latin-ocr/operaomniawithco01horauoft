OD. 20. 165

Dilecte, Maecenas, obibo
*Nec Stygia cohibebor unda.
Iam iam residunt cruribus asperae
Pelles, et album *mutor in alitem 10
superne, nascunturque leves
Per digitos humerosque plumae.
Iam* Daedaleo notior Icaro
Visam ‘gementis litora Bospori
Syrtesque Gaetulas canorus , 15
Ales Hyperboreosque campos.
Me Colchus et' qui dissimulat metum
Marsae'cohortis Dacus et ultimi
Nescent Geloni, me perit-us
Discet Hiber Rhodanique potor. 20·
Absint inani funere neniae ¹ ⁵ ⁶
Luctusque turpes et querimoniae3
Compesce clamorem ac sepulcri

Mitte supervacuos honores.

9. ⁶ The skin roughens and shrinks to
my legs, as they also shrink into the legs
osa bird) Notice the antithetical‘ as-
perae. .':leves see on 1. 3’6. 16.

11. superne. The e is short, asin
Lucr. 6. 543 and 596: see Wagner’s

v Plaut. Aulul. Introd. p. xxiii.

13. notior, so Keller edits, following
the readings of B and A (though ⁶ cor-
rected' in the latter by a second hand
to ‘ otior’). A large number have ‘ocior.’
The hiatus in that case must be defended
by the same considerations as ‘ periret ' in
3. 5. 17: the caesura separates two parts

‹;of an asynartete verse. Bentley proposed
’ tguatztffid the hiatus. but on the ground

and Lachmann follows him, not

it is not here as thgre an effort of his
genius, which might be unsuccessful, of
which heis speaking. He sa s that by
his poetic fame he will be own to
further regions (or that he will travel
saster) than if he had the wings of
Icarus. The fate of Icarus is not in
question. ‘JDaedaleo not a needless
patronymic3 but 1. q. ope Daedaloe7'

make wings for him.¹

14. gementis, 2. 13. 14, 3. 4. 40.
The names seem to be selected, as Dillr.
remarks, in stanza 4 as those of strange
and barbarous peoples, in stanza 5 for
distance—east, north, west.

15. canorus aloe. The ‘white’ (v. 10)

and‘ tuneful' bird is not named, but is ·

clearly the swan. Cp. 4. 3.19 Omutis
quoque piscibus Donatura cycni si libeat
sonum’ ;ib. 2. 2 5 Dircaeum cymum’;
Virg. E. 9. ²7·

17. qui dissimulat, fears, though he
tries to hide his fear.

19. peritus. Orelli takes this pro-
leptically, ‘ when he learns anything
shall leam of me.' Ritter thinks there
is a distinction drawn between the
Spaniard and Gaul as already ‘ periti,'
and the barbarous Colchian, etc.

2ο. Rhodani potor. For the form
of expression see on 3.10.1: cp.

15. 21.

4 21. inani funere, there must be no
dirge, sor there wiu' be none to bury.
See Ennius’ epitaph ln Introd.

²4· supervacuos, ‘unmeaning' The
word 1s not found before Horace3 Cicero
uses‘ supervacaneus’
