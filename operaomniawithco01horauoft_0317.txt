LIB. IV. OD. 4.

Olim iuventas et patrius vigor ε,
Nido laborum propulit inscium
¹ Vernique iam nimbis remotis
Insolitos docuere nisus
Venti paventem, mox in ovjlia
Demisit hostem vividus impetus, , . 10
Nunc in reluctantes dracones
Egit amor dapis atque pugnae;
Qualemve laetis caprea pascuis
Intenta fulvae matris ab ubere

thss'kfflff ‘233⁵ ctssoinf‘f'ssffnsss‘ {iffa}
mark stages in the young bird's progress ;
so that it will mean πάλαι, ‘long ago‚' and
is defined by ‘laborum inscium‚’ ‘ere yet
he knew life's labours! It is otherwise
taken as merely generalising—-alerbv
τινα, ποτέ; see on Epod. 3. 1.
iuventas et patrius vigor, ‘ his
young blood and the force os his race.'

6. propulit. So Cruq. on the au·
.thority ot} two os his Bland. MSS, and
it is accepted by all recent editors ; the
larger number of MSS. have ‘ protulit.’
The time of the perfect tenses is that of
the Greek aorist in similes.

7. verni. Bentley seels strongly the
objection raised by Jul. Caes. Scaliger,
that eaglets are not hatched till late in
the spring, and would not be fit to fly
far till autumn. He prefers ‘ vemis‚'
which has some MS. support, and which
he judges to have been the reading of
Acron, from his illustration ‘ut ‘⁵ ruit
imbriferum ver”.' Probably ‘ nimbis
remotis’ is enough to account for the
Scholiast's quotation; the sound and
balance of the sentence are in favour of
‘verni.’ We need not expect Horace to
date the eaglet’s growth with the accu—
racy of an omithologist. He is more
likely to use the epithet ‘vernus' in a
pleasing sense of the soft breezes, than in
association merely with storms. ‘Verni ’
need not mean the first days of spring,
nor is the eaglet said yet to be fit for
hunting; it is of the first stage in the
art of flying. For a conj. alteration of
Horace’s text on somewhat similar

’ grounds see 1. 23· 5.

10. vividus impetus, of the actual
rusb, swoop, of his descent3 ·demittit
impetus aquilam ’=‘ aquila cum impetu
defertur? It has also been taken os his

Ἴ impetuous temper; but it suits Horace's

economy of words, that the motive in
this clause should be gathered from
the ‘ amor dapis atque pugnae ' (a dainty
banquet, with the excitement of fighting
for it) of the second clause, the mode
of attack in that clause from the ⁶ vividus -
impetus ’ of this, as the unresisting weak—
ness of the sheep is lest to be inserted
from the epithet given to the serpents.

14. fulvae matris ab ubere. Some

awkwardness has been felt in this ex- “

pression, as, if we construet it with
‘ depulsum‚’ either ⁶ ab ubere’ or ⁶ lacte’
would seem to be redundant¹ (cp. Virg. s
E. 7. 17 ‘depulsos a acte: G. 3. 187
‘ depulsus ab ubere matris ')‚ and various
modes of treatment have been suggested.
⁴ Ub'ere ¹ has been taken as an epithet of
‘lactess but this is to transfer the redun—
Qaney from the expression to the thought:
or, again, ‘fulvae matris ab ubere( has
been referred to the—hind (Ritter), but it
is hard to see how this adds to the pie-
ture; the youth os the lion is in point,
and the preoccupation of the hind‚ but
we do not want in any way to under-
‚yalue Drusus' foes. Bentley led the way
”of conjectural emendation, ‘iam mane'
or ‘ iam sponte,’ and has been followed
by many others. The simplest method
is-to separate ‘ab ubere' to some ex-

tent from ‘depulsum’ and to take it in ’

the sense of ‘fresh from his mother’s
teats? Cp. ‘a matre pulli‚’ Columel„
‘recens a vulnere,' Virg. Aen. 6. 450;
the place of Virgil's ⁴ reeens ’ is supplied
by the more definite ⁶ lacte depulsum! -
