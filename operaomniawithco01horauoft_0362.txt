HORATII CARMEN SECULARE.

Semper et culti, date, quae precamur
Tempore sacro,

’ Quo Sibyllini monuere versus

Virgines lectas puerosque· castos

Dis, quibus septem placuere colles,
Dicere carmen.

Alme Sol, curru nitido diem qui

Promis et celas aliusque et idem

Nasceris‚ possis nihil urbe Roma
Visere maius.

Rite maturos aperire partus

Lenis, Ilithyia, tuere matres,²

Sive tu Lucina probas vocari
Seu Genitalis.

Diva, producas subolem patrumque

Prosperes decreta super iugandis

5. Sibyllini versus. The books
which were reported to have been
bought of the Sibyl by Tarquin had
been destroyed in the buming of the
temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, Β. c. 82;
but a fresh collection of Sibylline pro-
phecies had been made. Augustus had
caused them to be examined‚ and many
that were deemed spurious to be burnt.
The remainder were deposited by him
in two gilt cases at the base of Apollo's
statue in his temple on the Palatine
(Suet. Aug. 31). They were in the keep-
ing of the ⁴ quindecimviri ' (see on v. 7ο),
who alone were allowed to read them.

6. Both epithets apply to each sub-
stantive3 see on Od. 3. 4. 18, 4. 9. ²9·
For the principles of the selection see
extract from Zosim. l. 30 foll„ and cp.
Od. 4. 6. 31 ‘ Virginum primae puerique
claris Patribus orti.'

7. placuere. The perfect is regular:
‘in whose sight the seven hills have
found favour! It is more definite and
final than ⁶ placent?

10. The connection between the de·
scription and the prayer seems to be,
‘ unehangeable yourself, though you
cause change and seem to change, give
to -the pre-eminence of Rome the same
unchangeableness!

13. rite, probably ‘ aster thine office ' 3
cp. Virg. Aen. 3. 36, 10. 254 ‘aperire
lenis'; see App. 2, ξ 2.

14. Ilithyia. The Greek goddess of

birth, identified subsequently with Arte- ,
mis. Horace offers two alternative Latin
names: Lucina, ‘she that brings to the
light: a name which Diana shared with
Juno, though ⁶ Iuno Lucina ’ is some·
times treated as a name or phase of
Diana herself, as Catull. 34. 13 ⁸ Tu
Lucina dolentibus Iuno dicta puerperis ';
and Genitalis, a title nowhere else given
to her, though intelligible in itself. pos-

sibly a Latinised form of reverto-Me, a ’

name given in this connection to A
dite and Artemis. Bentley wished ac-
tually to read ⁴ Genetyllis.' The choice
of title offered to a god is commem cp.
Catull. 1. c.‚ especially v. 21 ‘Sis uo-
cunque placet tibi Sancta nomine? ‘il‘he
prayer to Ilithyia, as those to the Parcae
(Μοῖραι), vv. 25-28‚ and to Tellus (Γαΐα),
vv. 29-32. were part of the pmcribed
ceremonia13 see Zos. l. c. The relation ·
of stanzas 3 and 4, is pointed by the
ἓξὶιΨ-άιξῗὲ Ἦὲἷέξῖἳῖἒαψαηξεέἓῗξ
differ'ent ways ‘ life-giving ’ powers.-
Rome’s greatness cannot be separated
from the well-being and fruitfulness of
Roman mothers. The male chorus
(according to Steiner and Ritter) take up
the maidens' prayer, and apply it spe-
cially to Augustus' legislative efforts to
encourage legitimate marriage.
