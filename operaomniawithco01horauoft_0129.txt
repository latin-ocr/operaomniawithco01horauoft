LIB. I. OD. 29. 87

O D E XXIX.

*ΨΜ-ι’, Iccius hankering after the treasures of Arabia, and planning eastern
conquests? Have you chosen already your share of the spoil? Who will say
again that aught in nature is impossible, when Iccius the scholar sells his library
to buy armour and belies the promise of his lise ? ’

Iccius is unknown to us except from this Ode and Epp. 1. 12. In that Epistle.
wn'tten probably about five years afterwardsshe has resumed his peacesul pursuits,
if he ever lest them, and is engaged as manager of Agrippa’s estates in Sicily.
We must not take Horace's banter here or his imputation of avaricious motives as
serious. Some readers see in the openings‘lines of the Epistle a hint of restlessness
in Iceius' disposition, but Horace speaks of him as a man of singularly temperate
life and a rare example of the possibility of maintaining a pure and lofty taste :-

‘inter scabiem et contagia lucri!
In the year 24 B..c Aelius Gallus made an unsuccesssul expedition into Arabia

’ lim-*mde- y'ffiave been written when the preparations for it
Δ had begun, but these seem to have lasted some time3 see on Od. 1. 35. 30.

ICC1‚ beatis nunc Arabum invides
Gazis, et acrem militiam paras
Non ante devictis Sabaeae
Regibus, horribilique Medo
Nectis catenas? Quae tibi virginum 5
Sponso necato barbara serviet?

f the Σαβά,

 

1. beatis, properly the epithet of the

⁴ ‘rich man, not of his ricl1es; but it con-

tains a reference to the name of Arabia

Fehiiiim. Dillr. points out the emphasis

laid on this word. . ‘ What, now, after a

lifetime spent in such different pur-

Dict. Geog. 5. v. Sabaei.

3. Sabaeae, the name of the most
important city and tribe of S. Arabia,
‘‚’Sheba of 1 Kings 10.1.

4. Medo, a hyperbole, possibly of

⁴ those who vapoured about the expedi-

ti0n; but it is in Horace’ 5 way, cp. Od.
1. 12. 56, 1. 35. 31. We may notice
the terms of playful exaggeration in
which Iccius’ part in the expedition is
spoken of. Itis he that plans the war,
that carries chains ready made for his
captives (as Florus, .‚7 relates that
Μ Antonius, the father of the Triumvir,
did when he attacked Crete): he is to
have the pick of the spoil, his Briseis
like Achillpes, a court page as his cup-
bearer.

5. quae virginum barbara, for
‘quae virg 0 barbara’ or quae virginum
barbararum. ’ Horace‘ 15 fond of varia·
tions of the kind; cp.Epod.10.13
‘Graia victorum manus; '.Sat 2. 1. 61
‘majorum nequis amicas! He 2s speak—
ing of a princess‚ the· bellantis tyranni
adulta virgo 'of od. 3. 2. 7.
