O D E XXVIII.

Τιιε poet represents himself as about to celebrate the ‘ Neptunalia' by a carouse,
in company with Lyde a ⁴ psaltria.’ Cp. 4. 11. ‘What can he do better on such a
day? He bids her ⁶ bustle about and bring out the old Caecuban ; their sobriety
will need a good deal of storming. There is no time to lose3 the day is already
waning. They will sing in turns: he of Neptune and the Nereids, she of Latona

, and Diana 3 then both together of Venus and of Night.’

The Neptunalia were held on July 23. Festus mentions the custom of cele-
brating the day by erecting booths of boughs called ‘ umbrae ¹ along the bank of
the Tiber.

FESTO quid potius die

Neptuni faciam? Prome reconditum
Lyde strenua Caecubum

Munitaeque adhibe vim sapientiae.
Inclinare meridiem - 5

Sentis ac„ veluti stet volucris dies,
Parcis deripere horreo

Cessantem Bibuli consulis amphoram.
Nos> cantabimus invicem

Neptunum et virides Nereidum comas;
Tu curva recines lyra

Latonam et celeris spicula Cynthiae,

2 reconditum, put safely away in
“the mner bins· cp. ‘interiore nota? 2. 3. 8.
3. strenua, with‘ promel ‘be vigor-
ous and bring' ; it almost begins the
metap hor of the next verse, ‘show
vigorous generalship. ' The Caecuban
is the artillery that must be brought to
bear against the strong entrenchments
of their seriousness.
Caecubum3 on 1. 20. 9.
4. sapientiae, 3. 21. 14.
5. inclinare meridiem, in prose,
‘sol meridie se inclinavit‚’ Liv. 9. 32.
‘the noon has passed its full’ There, if

³ anywhere, the day might be expected

stare] It need not imply any very
early hour.

7. horreo, a ‘'store generally, having
lost its original meaning of a store of
grain; 1. 1. 9. Here it is=‘apotheca';

· see on 3. 21. 7.

8. cessantem, as though it were the

fault of the wine that it carne no quicker.

Bibuli. C. Calpurnius Bibulus, eos.
with C. Julius Caesar, ac. 59. There
is doubtless a play on his name.

9. nos cantabimus· invicem. Either ,
‘'nos = ‘ego‚’ 3. 11. 51, 3. 27. 14, and
‘invicem’ meaning‘ in my turn'; or,

more likely (as Orelli), ‘We will sing in
turn (⁶ carmine amoebaeo’ ) of Neptune,
etc., the sentence beginning as though
‘invicem' would have been enough to
point out that ‘Neptune and the Nereids ’
were to be the subject of one's song,
Latona and Diana of the other’s, and
then ‘ tu recines ’ having been inserted to
make the antithesis more clear. For
the division cp. 1. 21.

1 1. recines, of an answering song, as
in 1. 12. 3 of an echo. The correspond-
ence of the songs is indicated by the
metrical correspondence of vv. 10 and
12.
