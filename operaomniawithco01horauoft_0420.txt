378 USE oF THE

special relation more exactly than is possible with the caseless infini-
tive. Thus we find with the infinitive, ‘ studeo: Cic. ; ‘,nitor,’ Nep.;
‘quaero‚' Cic.; ‘tendo‚' Liv.; ‘ pergo,' Cic.; ‘ persevero,’ Cic. Many
verbs hesitate between the two constructions‚ ‘statuo sacere’ or ‘ut
faciam,’ ‘prohibeo facere ’ or ‘ quominus facias.' The poets go
beyond the prose writers in this extension‚ greatly because their
diction substitutes more highly-coloured and metaphorical verbs for
the simplet ones of prose, ‘ gaude0,' ‘ gestio,’ ‘ am0,' ‘ ardeo: for ‘ volo,’
etc.; but Livy and Sallust anticipate some of the boldest poetical
applications of this liberty.

It seems useless to seek a full explanation of each case in the
doctrine that the infinitive was truly a substantive, which involves
the further difficulty that we must explain ‘in what relation (or ‘ case ')
it stands to the leading verb (see Conington’s note on Virg. G. 1.‘213).
A Roman poet felt at once the influence of Greek usage, in which
the infinitive never lost its substantiva! character, and of Latin prece-
dents‚ which, if they may be traced ultimately to a similar source, had
yet ceased to be coloured by any consciousness of it. That the infi- 1
nitive is treated at times by Horace as a substantive is clear from
such sentences as ‘ dulce et decorum est pro patria mori,' and from its
conjunction with a substantive in the instances quoted below from
Od. 2. 16. 39, Epp. 1. 19. 9.

The leading instances in Horace are, besides such common verbs
as ‘valeo,' ‘ mitt0,' ‘parco‚’ ‘sugio,'-—-

transire‚’ Liv. 1. 30).
