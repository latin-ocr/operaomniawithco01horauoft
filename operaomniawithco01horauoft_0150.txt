Caesar, ab Italia volantem(
Remis adurgens, accipiter velut
Molles columbas aut leporem citus
Venator in campis nivalis

Fatale monstrum: quae generosius
Perire quaerens nec muliebriter
Expavit ensem nec latentes

13. vix una sospes. For the con-
struction cp. 2. 4. 10 ‘ademptus Hector
Tradidit . . Pergama Graiis.' Horace,
in the desire to omit Antony’s name,
does not distinguish his fleet, whilewas
totally destroyed. from that of Cleo-
paittra, which fled without striking a
b ow.

14. lymphatam, ‘panic-stricken.'
Ρτορετῑγενυμφόπληκτον, panic terrers

epithet probably only implie‘s ‘in winter:
the appropriate time for hunting.

21. monstrum quae, a common con—
structio ad sensum. Cicero calls
Catiline ‘monstrum.' Cat. 2. 1; Lucan
oells Cleopatra ‘Latii feralis Erinnys: ’
10. .

ἐξ nee . . ensem. According to
Plutarch (Ant. 79) she attempted to stab
herself on the approach of Proculeius.

being attributed to the agency, amongst
other deities, of the Nymphs; but the
word, like panic itself, is generalized.
Here the effect is attributed to her
revels with Antony and the deep draughts
of Egyptian wine, for Bacchus too is the
author of such empty fears: cp. Eur.
Bacch. 303 foll. στρατὸν γὰρ ἐν ὅπλοιε
ὄντα κάπὶ τάξεσι φόβος διεπτόησε πρὶν
λόγχης θιγεῖν· μανία δὲ καὶ τοῦτ’ ἐστὶ
Διονύσου πάρα. It is opposed to ‘ veros
timores‚' ‘ the fears of soberness.’

Mareotico, a sweet wine from Marea,
a town of the Delta, mentioned but not
characterized by Virg. G. 2. 91.

16. ab Italia, not that she had
reached Italy, but that it was the object
of the ambitious schemes broken down
at Actium. A few of Octavius‘ ships
seem to have pursued Cleopatra for a
short way, but she escaped safely to
Alexandria. Horace marks no interval
between this and the autumn of the
following year, when Octavius followed,
to put a close to the war at Alexandria,
and Antony and Cleopatra escaped his
hands by a voluntary death.

πο. Haemoniae, poetical name of
Thessaly. mythically derived from
Haemon, the father of Thessalus. The

Augustus' emissary. but was prevented.
The next line and a half have reference
perhaps to a plan which, on the same
authority (ib. 69), she is said to have
entertained of carrying her fleet across
the isthmus, and escaping down the Red
Sea. .

interpreted by the Schol. Porph. took
it as a pregnant expression= ‘ ad laten-
tes oras fugit ut vires inde repararet!
It may mean no more than ‘ found some
fresh land out of the way of Caesar's
vengeance! It may also mean (see on
1. 31. 12) ‘purchased‚' ‘ used her fleet to²
win for herself? and there may be in it a
more or less oonscious remembrauoe of
the Greek uses of ἀμείβειν and ἀλλάτ-
τειν, for ‘to go to' some new place.
Bentley proposed ‘ penetravit‚’ and there
have been many other conjectures—⁴ cit·
are paravit: ‘ ire paravit,’ ‘ repetivit,’ etc.

25· ausa et..f0rti= et. There is
no verb understood. These are the
grounds of the foregoing statements, the
ingfinitive following ‘fortis,’ as in 1. 1.
1 ‚ etc.
