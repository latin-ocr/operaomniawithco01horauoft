THE SCHOLIASTS. xxi

‘defects must actually have existed: it becomes a question of less or
⁴ - more. But the antecedent probability of the suppositions which are
'necessary to any theory of the interpolation of spurious Odes or parts
'of Odes cannot be so easily granted. Every known fact in the history
’ of Horace's poems can be explained without such a theory, unless
indeed it be assumed that no poem or stanza which falls below his
ὅ highest poetical level can be genuine. On the other hand, as

Α Mr. Munro points out1, in his vigorous summary of the arguments
against the interpolation theory, the form of Horace's poems is
specially his own. We are asked to imagine that unknown poets‚
in the literary age of Rome, reproduced it with a skill and complete-
.ness of which the known poets who have tried to imitate it proved
themselves incapable. The editors who have done the most for the
interpretation of Horace 'in this generation (Orelli, Dillenburger,
Ritter) are the least disposed to allow of any spurious poems or
passages in his text. But though Peerlkamp’s method of criticism
must be pronounced baseless, we may trace from it, as from its pre-
decessor, indirect results of value in the astention which it calls to the
sequence of thought, the lights and shades of style, and the varying
merit of the poetry.
