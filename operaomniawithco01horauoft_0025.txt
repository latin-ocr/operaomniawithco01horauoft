MANUSCRIPTS. xvii

φ. Paris, 7974. The common readings of this and the last MS. are
marked by Keller and Holder by the letter F.
λ. Paris, 7972. This is one of the MSS. which contains the Mavor-
tian inscription3 see next page. With it Holder connects the
(l) Leyden MS, which was one of which Bentley made use. This
is marked l. Ὗ
u. Paris, 7973, belonged, like B and ψ, to Pierre Daniel.
π.“ Paris, 10310. Holder seems to put this MS. rather later, and
to attribute less value to it.
τ. Zurich. Carol. 6. With this Holder connects a MS. (D) of about
(D) the same age, which was in the library of Strasburg‚ and
perished in the recent siege. Keller has given, at the end of
vol. i, a list of its most important readings in the Odes 1, 2 and
3. 1, 2.

-σ. (Orelli's S) St. Gall.

To these Keller and Holder add a Paris MS. (7975) of the 11th
century, to which they both attribute high value (γ).

Of the roth century also 1s the MS. in Queen' s College, Oxford, a
collation of which‘ is given at the end of this volume (Regm)

It has been already suggested, that the only method by which con-
clusive evidence upon questions of disputed reading could be gathered
from MSS. of such late date, would be by grouping them' in families
or ‘recensions,’ each family being made by its common readings to
bear witness to some archetype of much greater antiquity than the copies
which we now possess This has been attempted by Keller, and
with more completeness by Holder1. A and a, λ and l, <11 and ψ, as
we have seen, have been supposed to be severally related in this way,
a'nd the readings of their imagined archetypes are indicated by Holder
by the signs A', λ’, F. With his fuller‘ apparatus criticus' on the
Satires and Epistles, the process is carried still further, and the result .
is, to the extent that uniform readings can be obtained, a certain

, number of conjecturally restored MSS. of the 7th and 8th centuries.

These and the other solitary representatives of older MSS. are again
grouped into three classes.

The first of these is distinguished as containing, with many faults of
carelessness, and with a certain number of grammatieal corrections

¹ The Prolegomena to Keller and responsible for the Odes and Epodes, in
Holder’s critical edition of Horace the Rhein. Mus. vol. xix, p. 211- 2-27; as
(Teubn. 1864 and 1868) are still to regards Holder, who undertakes the
come. Their general conclusions are Satires and Epistles, in the Presace to
to be found, as regards Keller, who is vol. ii.
