Nocte frequentes.

Quod semel dictum est stabilisque rerum

Iulia de maritandis ‘ordinibusss which
appears to have been enacted in 1³.c. 18.
Some uncertainty hangs over its provi-
sions, for we do not know to what
extent it was altered by the supplement-
ary law which was passed in B.c. 9, in
the consulship of M. Papius Mutilus
and Q. Poppaeus Secundus, and which

- causes the whole measure to be cited as

the ‘Lex Iulia et Papia Poppaea.' It
forbade marriage between persons of
senatorian family and ‘ libertinae‚' im-
posed penalties on celibacy (to the ex-
tent of the forfeiture of all bequests)
and even on childless marriages in all
ranks, and held out exemptions and
rewards to the fathers of legitimate
families. Dio briefly mentions its pro-

“ visions 54. 16; on the whole matter see

Merivale, c. 33, vol. iv, p. 85 foll. For
another reference to Augustus' legisla-

, tion on this subject see Od. 4. 5. 21, and

cp. Od. 1. 2. ²4·

‘feraci frondis in Algido ': cp. 3. 6. 17
and inf. v. ²9 ⁶ fertilis frugum!

20. marita, as an adjective, ‘the mar-
riage law’ 3 so Prop. 4. 11. 33 ⁴ facibus
maritis‚' Ov. Her. 1 2. 87 ‘sacris maritis.’

ξ 2. The *perfect tense, because he is
concerned, not with their prophecies
generally, but with their prophecies of
Rome‘s destiny3 see on 3. 4. 51. ’

Parcae3 see on v. 14. Orelli reminds
us that they would be the authors os
the Sibylline prophecies.

26—28. The relative clause seems
rightly taken by Ritter and Dillr. vsith
⁶ bona iungite fata‚’ in a similar con-struc-
tion to ‘ quod felix faustumque sit‚’ etc.⁵
‘As once and for aye has been pro-
mised—and Time’s landmark, that may
not be removed, protect the promise l·-
link happy destinies to those already
accomplished.' In ‘ dictum est,⁷ Horace
is remembering the etymology of‘ fatum!
In ‘ rerum Terminus' he is possibly
thinking of the landmark of Roman
empire that might never recede, and its
pledge in the statue of Terminus, who
would not give way even to Jupiter on
the Capitol (Ov. Fast. 2. 667 foll.); but
the metaphorical use occurs in Virg-
Aen. 4. 614 ‘Et sie fata Iovis poscunt,
hic terminus haeret: where we have
reminiscences of Accius, Fr. ‘ veter
fatorum terminus? and Lucr. 1. 78
‘alte terminus haerens.¹ Orelli reads
‘servat,’ after the Aldine edition (Lam-
binus praises. but does not print it). It
has the slightest MS. support, and, as
Bentley remarks, looks like a correction
to suit the mood of ⁵ est.' The sentence
‘ quod . . servat? would then be construct-
ed as the object of ⁴ cecinisse!
