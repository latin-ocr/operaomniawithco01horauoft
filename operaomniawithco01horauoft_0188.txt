146 HoRATn CARMINUM

O DE XIV.

‘Tne years are flying, Postumus3 no prayers will stay them; not three heca·
tombs a day will turn the heart of Pluto the tearkss, the almighty, who hold
Geryon sast, despite his three bodies, and Tityos, behind the Styx, aye, the Styx,
which we must all cross alike, rich and poor. You may avoid all common risks‚
yet you must die. The treasures that you have boarded your wiser heir will

squander.'

The burden is the same as that of Od. 2. 3 and 11, and of 4. 7 ‘ Life is short, let
us enjoy it while we may; ' but there is more of sadness in this Ode than in the
others. The usual moral is hinted in the passing epithet ‘ dignior’ bestowed on the
heir who is to waste our store of choice wine; but the feeling of the stanza is not so
much for his wisdom as for the additional bitterness which it adds to our labours
to know that they may be all undone as soon as we are dead. ⁸ We must leave it
unto a man that shall be after us, and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise
man or a sool?’ Eccles. 2. 19. There is no clue to the person addroesed. It has
been suggested that he may be the Postumus to whom Propertius writes his Elegy

(3. 12).
EHEU fugaces, Postume, Postume,
Labuntur anni nec pietas moram
Rugis et instanti senectae
Afferet indomitaeque morti:
Non, si trecenis, quotquot eunt dies, 5
Amice, places illacrimabilem
Plutona tauris, qui ter amplum
Geryonen Tityonque tristi

1. fugaces labuntur. We must not
try to harmonize the metaphor, although

both ‘fugax' (Od. 2. 3. 12) and ‘labi’
(Epp. 1. 2. 43) are used os running water:
—‘ the fleeting years slide by.' Words
are accumulated which convey the idea
of rapid and continuous motion, but the
mind does not dwell on the form long
enough to gain a distinct picture of the
metaphor by which in each case the
idea is conveyed to it.

2. pietas. Od. 4. 7. ²4· Cp. Ov. Am.
3. 9. 37 ‘ Vive pius, moriere pius; cole
sacra, colentem Mors gravis a templis
in cava busta trahet.’ ‘Pietas' is ex-
emplified in the next stanza.

3, 4. instanti, indomitae, the epi-
thets which signisy the nearness and the
certainty of the end of our pleasures are
divided between age and death.

5¹ non si, ‘no‚ not if: the negative

trecenis, · three hecatombs sor every

hyperbole, would interpret ⁸ trecenis' as
a round number standing sor the num-
