284 HORATII CARMINUM

ODE VI.

‘ Apono, terrible to thine enemies, as Niobe, Tityos, and great Achilles felt: yet
even in thy wrath the friend of Rome, for if Achilles had livedvTroy would have
perished, not, indeed, bytreachery, busin open war, which would have left no rem-
nant to fly to Italy ;——Apollo‚‘ whom we know-'tecching the cithara on Parnassus,
and bathing thy locks in the Xanthus ;—uphold to-day the honour of the Daunian
Muse. Aye, it is Apollo that inspires, macha, selects me. Listen to me, boys
and maidens of the chorus; take time from me, as you sing in turn Apollo and
Diana and their kindly offices to man. Some day the matron will tell her children
proudly “when the last Ludi Seculares were held, 1 took my part in them, and
sang the strains which the poet Horace taught me.'' ’

The Ode is, on the face of it, a sort of prelude to the Carmen Seculare; a. poet·
ical expression of the pride of the poet in his selection to write the Hymn, and of
his anxiety that it may receive justice in its public performance. His professed
purpose is to claim the good offices- first os Apollo, the powerful god to whose
intervention Rome owed her very existence, the god of Greek song; and then, when ·
this aid is assuoed, of the chorus of performers.

DIVE, quem proles Niobea magnae
Vindicem linguae Tityosque raptor ·
Sensit et Troiae prope victor altae
Phthius Achilles, ’
Ceteris maior, tibi miles impar, 5
Filius quamvis Thetidis marinae

 

1. Apollo is invoked first by virtue of
his sterner attributes as an avenger of
ὕβρις. Three instances are given from
mythology (according to the well-known
formula of Greek poetry)‚ the last being
skilfully turned into a glorification of
him as a θεὸς σώτηρ, the saviour of the
Aeneadae, whose inveterate foe he thus
removed.

magnae linguae, ‘ a vaunting tongue ’;
Soph. Ant. 127 Ζεὺς γὰρ μεγάλης γλώσ-
σης κόμπους ὑπερεχθαίρει. The boast of

, Niobe was that she had given birth to

more children than Latona. The story
is told m Hom. Il. 24. 602.

2. vindicem 1s grammatically limited
to the first clause by its connection with
the genitive ‘linguae'; but to be ex-
tended in sense to the other two the
kind of ὕβρις, of which he was the aven-
ger, being expressed in the first by the
epithet of⁴ Tityos raptor,’ in the second

by the fuller account of Achilles' bear-
ing towards-the vanquished.

Tityon 2. 14: 8, 3. 4. 77, 3. 11. τι,
Pind. P. 4. 90. His offence, an assault
on Latona, and his punishment in Tar-
tarus, are told in Hom. Od. 11. 576.

3. prope victor, ‘before he could
complete the victory which, by slaying.
Hector, he had all but won.' The death
of Achilles is treated by Homer (in
Hector's prophecy, Il. 22. 358) as the

joint work of Paris and Apollo; virgil

follows him, Aen. 6. 56 ‘ Phoebe. graves
Troiae semper miserate labores Dardana
qui Paridis direxti tela manusque Corpus
in Aeacidae'; Sophocles attributes it
directly to Apollo, Phil. 334 NE. τέθνη-
κεν, ἀνδρ ὸς οὐδενός, θεοῦ δ’ ὕπο Ι τοξεντὸ 8
ὡς λέγουσιν’ εκ Φοίβου δαμείς.

altae. The Homeric Ἰλίου αἰπεινῆς.

4. Phthius, Phthia is Achilles'
country in Homer, 11. 1. x 55, etc.
