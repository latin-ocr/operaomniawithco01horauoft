COMPLEMENTARY INFINITIVE. 381

· perire,’ ‘ piger ferre': it may cause some ambiguity when the negative

 

character of the adjective is less clear, or where it would have been
equally open to the poet to regard it from its positive side, and to
make the infinitive the complement of the whole, not merely of the
positive part, viz. the attribute denied or disparaged. Contrast, e. g,
‘ ferre iugum pariter dolosi' with ‘cautum dignos assumere,' ‘ calli-
dum condere,' etc. 3 (b) in such cases as the last three given above,
where the adjective and the infinitive seem to have changed places,
where it is no longer an inter-nal quality of the subject leading to some
action, but an aetion which is the cause or ground of the attribute, no
longer ‘brave so as to conquer‚’ but ‘ famous because he conquers.'

‘Niveus videri‚' Od. 4. 2. 59 (like ‘nefas videre,’ Epod. 16. 14),
seems to be more purely an imitation of a Greek idiom (λεῦκος ὁρᾶσθαι,
ἀθέμιτον ἰδεῖν).

INDEX OF METRES USED IN THE ODES
AND EPODES.

ξ 1. Asclqbz’ads.
Under this system are included five systems, composed of the fol-
lowing verses singly or in various combinations :—-

a. The lesser Asclepiad— .
- -ψ- - υυ-«Ῑ-υυῑ--υΞ

Maecenas atavis edite 'regibus

β. The greater Asclepiad4-

-—- -υυ- *1²³ υ- - uu — υ-Ψ-

Tu ne quaesieris scire nefas quem mihi quem tibi.

In these two verses the caesura is carefully kept, in a after the first,
in β after the second choriambus. The only exception in Horace's
writings is Od. 4. 8. 17 ‘ Non incendia Carthaginis impiae! In 1. 18.
16 and 2. 12. 25, the preposition gives a quasi—caesura.

γ. The Glyconic—

— --υυ -υ Ξ

Nil mortalibus ardui est.
