ODE XII.

ιΝο, Maecenas, my lyric style will not do for the great feats of Roman arms,
any more than it would for the heroic myths. You will celebrate Caesar's glories
, far better in your prose history. Ι will content myself with singing the charms of
„= , your Licymnia and your love for herl

With the Ode generally compare 1. 6.

The Scholiasts (on Sat. 1. 2. 64) give the tradition that Licymnia (or, as they
write it, ‘Licinnia,’ probably a corruption to suit her relationship to the Licinia
gens3 see Introd. to Od. 2. 10) is a name invented by Horace to veil and yet to
represent to the initiated that of Terentia, Maecenas' wife. For the practice both
in Horace and in other poets, see App. 1. ³

Bentley pointed out that the mention of the public dance in Diana’s honour,
implies that the person imagined is not merely a ⁴ libertina!

The third stanza seems clearly (though Orelli doubts it, taking ‘tu’ generally
‘you' or ‘any one’) to imply a hope or a wish that Maecenas may write some
memoirs of the reign of Augustus. Servius (on Virg. G. 2. 42) vouches for his
having done so; but the only older authority that can be quoted is a doubtful
expression of Pliny, N. H. 7. 46.
