316 INTRODUCTION TO THE

agree that they had only been celebrated four times before the age of
Augustus. There is no trace of the name ‘ Seculares’ before that
date, and what is said of the different celebrations goes to show that
they were called forth by special emergencies, not by any recurrence
of epochs. Still, there would seem to have been some tradition of
such recurrence to justify Augustus' revival. On the dates of the
celebrations Censorinus’ authorities differed. «The length of the
‘ seculum' itself was diversely given at 110, as *by Horace, and 100
years, as by Val. Antias, Livy, and Varro, whom Censorinus quotes.

The historical performances are at varying periods, but all with
some reference to an intended secular date. Merivale writes, ‘The
emperor Claudius repeated the games in the year A.u.c. 800, dis-
regarding those of Augustus as irregular. Claudius was disregarded
in his turn by Domitian, who renewed the celebration in 841, antici-
pating in his impatience, by six years, the period prescribed by
Augustus. To the Augustan computation Severus conformed pre-
cisely, and repeated the solemnity in 957, after two intervals of 110
years each. Philippus, however, returned once more to the precedent
of Claudius in the year of the City 1000. This was the last celebra· V
tion?

The occasion of Augustus’ revival or institution of these games
was the close of what may be considered the first decade of the
empire‚ the renewal to him (though professedly only for five years
more), at his own request, of the ‘ imperium‚' which in nc. 27 he had,
apparently with difficulty, been persuaded to accept for ten years.

The ‘quindecimviri’ (see on v. 70, and cp. Virg. Aen. 6. 73), the
custodians of the Sibylline Books, found in them the requisite instruc-
tions. Ateius Capito, a great jurist and antiquar-ian, was appointed
to settle the ceremonies, and Horace to compose the hymn. Some
doubt has been entertained whether this was to be performed in the
temple of Apollo Palatinus on the third day of the festival (see below,

extract from Zos. 1. 33), or during the sacrifices at the Tarentum on
the first night (ib. 1. 21).
