74 ' HORATII CARMINUM

Cantus, Melpomene, cui liquidam pater
Vocem cum cithara dedit.
Ergo Quintilium perpetuus sopor 5
Urget! cui Pudor et Iustitiae soror,
Incorrupta Fides, nudaque Veritas
Quando ullum inveniet parem?
Multis ille bonis flebilis occidit,
Nulli flebilior quam tibi, Virgili. 10
Tu frustra pius heu non ita creditum
Poscis Quintilium deos.
1 Quid si Threicio blandius Orpheo

Auditam moderere arboribus fidem,

3. Melpomene, see on Od. 1. 1. 33,
and cp. 3. 30. 16, 4. 3. 1.

5. ergo. S. 2. 5. 101 ‘Ergo nunc
Dama sodalis Nusquam est ' ⁸? cp. Virg.
E. 1. 47 ‘Fortunate senex, ergo tua
rura manebunt.’ So Ovid begins Trist.
3. 2. 1 ‘Ergo erat in fatis Scythiam
quoque visere nostris.’ Like the Gr.
ἄρα, it indicates a conclusion forced on
the speaker to his surprise.

perpetuus, broken by no waking,
ἀτέρμονα νήγρετον ὕπνον, Mosch. 3. 110.
Catull. 5. 5 ‘Soles occidere et redire
possunt: Nobis quum semel occidit
brevis l‚ux Nox est perpetua una dor-
mienda.

6. urget, ‘lies heavy on'; Od. 4. 9.
27 ‘ Urgentur . . longa nocte ' ; Virg. Aen.
10. 745 ‘ Olli dura quies oculos et ferreus
urget Somnus?

Pudor, αἰδώς. According to the de-
finition in A. Gell. 19. 6 ‘timor iustae
reprehensionis‚' the sensitiveness to the
judgment of others, which makes a man
modest, harmless‚ temperate.

7. Fides, defined by Cic. Off. 1. 7
‘ dictorum conventorumque constantia
et veritas,’ and called there ‘iustitiae
fundamentum! In calling Good Faith
or Honour the sister of Justice, Horace
implies that the two go together, and
therefore that both were present in
Quintilius.

nuda Veritas, as Aer. explains,
‘quae nihil occulti habeat ut egeat
‘ tegumento! Ritter compares the pic-
ture of Quintilius, the candid critic of
AdP. 438 foll.; see Introduction to this
O e.

. 8. inveniet, for the sing. verb after

several subjects, see od. 1. 3. 3. ⁴

11. frustra pius. 'VirgiL the gentle
and reverent poet, has committed ‘his
friend to the sase keeping of the gods,
little dreaming how they would dis-
charge the trust; now he asks back his ι
‘depositum’ (cp. Od. 1. 3. 5-8) only to
find how fruitless his piety has been.
Another interpretation is that of Lam-
binus, ‘Thou askest Quintilius of the
gods, and findest, despite thy piety,
that he was not lent to thee on such
terms,' i. e. that you should never part.
The first is probably right as assign-
ing the same agent to⁴ ⁸ creditum' and
⁸ poscis: and as giving a more definite
sense and connection with the context
to ‘frustra pius.' With the thought
of these words we may perhaps com-
pare, as a characteristic difference
between the two poets, Virgil’s notice
of the same moral difficulty, Aen.
2. 426-430, and his more reverent
and religious comment, ‘ Dis aliter
visum?

ita = ⁸ hac conditione,' on such te
as this.

13—15. quid si . . num. The words
⁶ frustra pius’ have struck the note
which is the key to this stanza. ‘In
vain—did‘l say ?—while he was alive.
What if you had the persuasive lyre of
Orpheus? could it restore to us the
dead?‘ Orelli reads ‘
but against the preponderanoe of MSS.

For the construction, a hypothetioel ,

question preceded by the interrogative
or exclamatory ‘quid,’ Dillr. refers to
S. 2. 3. 159, Epp. 1. 19. 10, Virg. Aen.

4. 311.

Quod si . . non‚’ ⁴
