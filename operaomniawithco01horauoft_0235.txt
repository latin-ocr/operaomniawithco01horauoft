LIB. ΙΙΙ. OD. 6. 193

-gives pleasure is not unbn'dled pas·- intellectual side of the pleasure added
sion, but passion felt to be measured to poetry by the recurrences of rhyme
and controlled by mind. This is the and metre.

oDE VI.

‘Wn are suffen'ng for our fathers' sins. They let the temples go to ruin. They
let the sacredness of marriage laws be tampered with. Our blood is poisoned, and
we go from bad to worse. They sprang from different parents, and had healthier
homes, who conquered Pyrrhus and Antiochus and Hannibal. Our sons will be
worsev than we are. Where is the remedy ἰ’ ’

This Ode is the complement of the last. -It traces to its source the decline of
the military spirit of which that complained, and includes in the arraignment
Roman daughters and mothers. As that points to Augustus’ plans of foreign
conquest, so this points to his restoration of temples and· religious ceremonial
(cp. 2. 15) and his legislation on social. questions (cp. 3. 24; 4. 5. 21 f011.; Carm.
Saec. 17. 20). Cp. Suet. Aug. 30, and Merivale, ch. 33.

DELJCTA maiorum immeritus lues,
Romane, don‘ec templa refeceris

Aedesque labentes deorum et

, Foeda nigro simulacra fumo.
Dis te minorem quodi geris, imperas: , 5
Hinc omne principium, huc refer exitum.

Di multa neglecti dederunt

Hesperiae mala luctuosae. “

1. immeritus, not that Horace
would say generally that the existing
generation was innocent, but their
punishment was not all for their own
sins. In part they were ⁶ paying sor the
sins of their sires in which they had had
no share,’ and would continue to pay
· for them till they undid thern.

a. Romane, a general address to the
people, Sat. 1. 4. 85; cp. A. P. 54,
Virg. Aen. 6. 852.

· templa . . aedesque, synonyms, the
second substantive being only a vehicle

Ἴ for the epithet. like Virgil's ‘ Limen erat

caecaeque fores . . postesque relicti!
refeceris, the task that Augustus
was engaged in, Suet. Aug. 30 ‘Aedes

sacras vetustate collapsas aut incendio
absumtas refecit?

4. fumo, perhaps from the ‘incendia'
of which Suet. 1. c. speaks.

5. te minorem geris, cp. 1. 12. 57
ἱ) Te minor latum* reget aequus οι·-

em.’

6. hine, sc. ‘est.' Liv. 45. 39 ‘ma-
iores vestri omnia magnarum rerum et

principia exorsi ab Dis sunt et finem ⁴

statuerunt: It is the forgetfulness of
this which has constituted the ⁴ neglect'
of the next verse.

For the scansion of principium see
on 3. 4. 41.

7. neglecti, ‘because they were for-
gotten,’ 3. 2. 30 ⁴ Diespiter neglectus:
