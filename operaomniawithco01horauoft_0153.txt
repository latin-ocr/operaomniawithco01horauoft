LIBER SECUNDUS.

ODE I.

‘ Pontio is writing the tale of the civil wars, a difficult and delicate task. We
can afford to let even his tragedies wait awhile, till the great and brave orator of
the forum and the, senate, and the conqueror of Illyria, has given us his history.
In our eagerness we seem already to hear the trumpets and see the flashing amour,
to hear him reading to us of the fall of chieftains and the conquest of all the world
save Cato’s stubborn soul. Ay, Jugurtha is avenged now! What land or sea is
not red with the blood of our sratricidal wax-s? But stay, my Muse, these are no

themes for you.’

There is nothing to fix very definitely the date of the Ode. The expressions of

, the two first stanzas‚ ‘nondum expiatis‚‘ ‘cineri doloso? perhaps attract it to the .

odes (such as 1. 2 and 14) which dweu more on the troubles from which the State
had already escaped3 than on the new and peaceful order on which it had entered.

, Augustus is not mentioned. Pollio had not sided with him, and had certainly been
'- a friend of M. Antony. But the Ode expresses, as strongly as Od. 1. 2, that weari-
’· ness of bloodshed which had induced men to acquiesce in the rule of one.

ζ , C. Asinius Pollio, the friend and supporter os Julius Caesar, having passed
Β through the Consulship in κιο. 40 (Virg. E. 4), and won the honours of a triumph
' for his campaign against the Illyrians (ib. 8. 6—13)‚withdrew from public life, and,

² in the subsequent struggle between Antony and Octavius, remained honourably

’ ne'utral. He was a magnificent patron of literature,and is famous as having estab-
· ‘lished the first public library at Rome out of the spoils os his Illyrian campaign.
” Hewas also one of the most accomplished men of the age. Catullus (12. 9) speaks
' of him in his youth as ‘leporum Disertus puer et facetiarum! He is ranked among
.³ the great orators by Quintilian (10. 1. 1 13), Seneca (Epist. 100), and Tacitus (De Or.
' 38). His tragedies are spoken of in high terms by Virgil (E. 8. 10 ‘ sola Sophocleo
. tua carmina 'digna cothurno ') and Horace (Sat'. 1. 10. 42). His history of the
5 civil wars. from B.c. 60 to the establishment of Augustus’ power, is referred to by

Ἰ Tacitus (Anu. 4. 34), Suetonius (J ul. Caes. 3ο).
’ , We may notice the skill'with which. Pollio's various accomplishments are worked

‚ 'incidentally into the Ode.
