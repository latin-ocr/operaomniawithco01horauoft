, ‘Tim Muse’s friend, Ι can cast sorrow and fears to the winds. The politics of
’ Parthia that trouble all the world are nothing to me. Help me, sweet Muse, to
⁴ weave a chaplet of freshest lyric verse for my dear friend Lamia!

Ἰ It is difficult to see the point of connection between the first and last parts of the
Γ ode, unless, indeed, as has been suggested. Horace is holding up his own cheerfulness
and its source to Lamia’s imitation, see Introd. to Od. 3. 17. If Epp. 1. 14. 6 refer
j to the same person as the two Odes, the trait there given, ⁴ rapto de fratre dolentis
Ι ’ Insolabiliter: may confirm the idea that he was a person on whom sorrow sat
, heuvily.

Aelius Lamia, the school friend of 'Numida (Od. 1. 36. 7) and the ‘vetusto no-
bilis ab Lamo’ of 3. 17. 1, is generally identified with L. Aelius Lamia who was
Praefectus urbi in Am. 32, and died As). 3 3. Tac. Ann. 6. 27 ‘ genus illi decorum,

“ been quite a young man when it was written. Ritter, feeling this to be a difficulty,
’ suggests that the Lamia of the Odes is an elder brother of Lucius. The name of
J ι Q. Aelius Lamia, ‘triumvir monetalis‚’ has been found on a coin of this date.

‘ On the date of the Ode and the allusion of vv. 3-5 see Introd. to Odes i-iii, § 8.

With vv. 1-6 cp. Virg. G. 2. 490÷497. The friendship of the Muses gives to

,⁴ Horace the freedom which Virgil attributes to philosophy and a country life.
