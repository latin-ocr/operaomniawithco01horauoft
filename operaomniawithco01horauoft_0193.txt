’ 'LIB. 11. OD. 16.

Condidit lunam neque certa fulgent
Sidera nautis;
Otium Qsudpsa-Thrace, 5
Otium Medi pharetra decori,
Grosphe‚ non gemmis neque purpura ve-

 

nale neque auro.'
Non enim gazae neque consularis.
Summovet lictor miseros tumultus 10
Mentis et· curas laqueata circum
Tecta volantes.
Vivitur parvo bene, cui paternum
Splendet in mensa tenui salinum,
Nee leves somnos timor aut cupido 15
Sordidus aufert.
Quid brevi fortes iaculamur aevo

Multa ?

Thracian sigh is the same which is the
true subject of the Ode. ‘The trader
prays for [bodily] rest, but it is only in
the moment of storm3 the Thracian, the*
Mede—but their hearts are in war; we
too wish for rest [of mind], but spend
our lives in the cares and hurry which
banish it?

2. prensus, καταληφθείς, apparently
a technical word for ⁶ caught in a
storm,' as ⁸ deprensus,’ Virg. G. 4. 421.

3. certa, ‘ on which to rely,’ not as
though there were some stars ‘ certa,’
others ‘ incerta.’

5. bello furiosa, Ἀρειμανής, ‘ Ma-
vortia tellus,’ Virg. Aen. 3. 13.

6. pharetra. decori. Their very
adomment belies their prayer.

7. Grospho. The personal address
serves to point the separation of the
allegory from its applicationx ‘ for
peace, Grosphus,—peace, which gems,
etc„ will not buy.'

non venale, οὐκ ὠνητόν, Thuc. 3. 40,
etc. For the division of the word be-

“ tween the two verses see Od. 1. 2. 20,

1. 25. 11.

10. summovet, the proper word of a
lictor clear-ing the way for the consul,
‘ i, lictor, summove turbam,’ Liv. 3. 48,
ete. ‘They tumults' of thelmind is a
continuation of the metaphor.

11. Cares are represented as a flock
of ill-omened birds or harpies that fly
round and round *under the panelled

Quid terras alio calentes

roof of the rich man's hall.

means be small, on whose modest board,'
etc.; ‘vivere parvo’ occurs Sat. 2. 2. 1.
The silver salt-cellar (Pers. S. 3. 25
‘ rure paterno Est tibi far modicum
purum et sine labe salinum ²), an heir-
loom of the house, is used as a test of
respectable competence. Poverty would
use a shell (Sat. 1. 3. 14 ‘concha salis

‘ tenui.’ It is the ‘ one ornament of the
modest board,’ perhaps-also like the

peti? Od. 1. 3. 36; no trouble or dis-
appointment daunts us, ⁴ Brevi' an-
swers to ⁸ multa.’ Life is too short for
many aims; the metaphor of ⁴ iacula-
mur ' is that of the Gr. τοξεῦειν, Soph-
O. Τ. 1196, etc.
