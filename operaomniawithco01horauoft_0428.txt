386 INDEX oF METRES.

It occurs in Od. 1. 8.
9. Hz‘pponacleum, Od. 2. 18. .
Α couplet consisting of a Trochaic Dimeter Catalectic‚ followed
by an Iambic Trimeter Catalectic :--
-υ -- υ - υ Ξ,
Ξ-υ-Ὰ--υ-υ-Ξ.
10. Ionicus a minore, Od. 3. 12.

This is composed entirely of the foot called ‘ Ionicus a minore ’ :—-

υ υ ““ -ο

The metre is described by Hephaestion, who takes as his type an
Ode of Alcaeus, of which the first line, which he quotes, seems as if it
may have been the original of Horace's Ode (see Introd. to Od. 3. 12).
It is not, he says, as it may easily be taken to be, an unbroken succes-
sion of similar feet, but broken into periods of ten feet each. Bentley
pointed out that Horace's Ode consists of forty feet, i.e. four such
periods, and held that the arrangement in lines, which many editors

debate, was merely a necessity of the writer or printer, and not to be r
elevated into a law of the metre.

ξ 6. Α few words may be added on what is called by some editors
‘Meineke’s canon? He noticed that, with two exceptions, all the
Odesl of Horace containa number of lines which is a multiple of four.
Of these, 3. 12 has just been discussed. It has been arranged by some
persons in stanzas of four lines (see Excurs. on it in Orelli's edition);
but it might fairly be contended, either that the nature of the metre
consisting not of verses, but of feet, exempted it from the common
category, or that, inasmuch as it consists of four periods of ten feet ἢ
each, it complies with the same conditions as other Odes. The other
exception is Od. 4. 8, which contains thirty-four verses. It so
happens that this Ode already lay under some suspicion, on account
of the historical difficulty of v, 17 ². On this facts Meineke laid
down the general law that all the Odes conformed to the type of the
Alcaic‚ Sapphic, and third, fourth, and fifth Asclepiad menes, and
were to be broken into four-line stanzas. Od. 4. 8 was to be rectified

² The law is not applied to the Epodes‚ ² Bentley had complained os the same
the very name of whlch (see p. 327) line, on account of the metrical irre-

probably implied an arrangement in gularity of the caesura; see above,
couplets rather than four-line stamas, ς 1.
