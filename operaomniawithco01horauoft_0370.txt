HORATH EPODON '

Quid nos, quibus te vita si superstite 5
Iucunda, si contra, gravis?
Utrumne iussi persequemur otium,
Non dulce, ni tecum simul‚'
An hunc laborem mente laturi decet
Qua ferre non molles viros? 10
Feremus et te vel per Alpium iuga
Inhospitalem et Caucasum
Vel Occidentis usque ad ultimum sinum
Forti sequemur pectore.
Roges, tuum labore quid iuvem meo, 15
Imbellis ac firmus pamm?
Comes minore sum futurus in⁴ metu,
Qui maior absentes habet;
Ut assidens implumibus pullis avis ,
Serpentium allapsus timet ‘20
Magis relictis, non, ut adsit, auxili
Latura plus praesentibus.

5. si superstite. This was read by
Porph„ who notices the difficulty of
construction, and gives the true explana-
tion, viz. that ‘ sit ⁹ has to be understood
both with ‘ te superstite ’ and with ‘ con-
tra,’ ‘ if it be spent in thy lifetime.' It
is not harder than ‘ni tecum simul ’ just
below. A few MSS. omit ‘ si‚' leaving
the verse unmetrical, and some of the
old editions have ⁸ sit: Ritter ex conj.
‘ si est?

7. utrumne . . an. Cicero has (pro
Quint. 30) ‘ utrum possitne se . . defen-
dere . . an . . addicatur: where the usage
is logically correct, ‘which of the two
things? this? or that ⁴? ' The coalescing
of the two words is poeticaL and does
not appear in prose writers till the silver
age. Horace uses ⁶ ne ’ with interroga-
tives more freely than other writers, eg.
‘ uteme‚’ Sat. 2. 2.107‚ ‘quine,’ Sat. 1.10.
21, ‘ quone‚' Sat. 2. 3. 295, ‘ quantam:
Sat. 2. 3. 317. ’

iussi, ‘ as you bid us.’

9. Best taken with Nauck, ‘ An hunc
laborem [persequemur]‚ laturi [eum]
mente‚' etc. He points out that ⁸ Fere-
mus’ answers the question of ‘laturi,'
⁸ sequemur ¹ (v. 14) of ‘ persequemur!
Others make ‘ laturi ’=‘ laturi sumuS,'
the verb of the sentence.

12. inhospitalem Caucasum, Od. 1.
22. 6.

13. sinum, Virg. G. 2. 123 ⁶ extremi
sinus orbis,' where see Conington. It
would seem here to mean the last wind-
ing of the shore as it trends westward
towards the Atlantic, so that it is the
equivalent of ‘ Gades’ in od. 2. 6. 1.

16. See on Od. 2. 7. 10. '

19. assidens, of the general time that
she has a callow brood‚ for at the
moment, ex hypothesi, she has left
them.

21. ut adsit, ‘even supposiri'g she
were present‚’ Madvig. L. G. ξ 440 a,
obs. 4, so Cic. pro. Mil. 17, ‘Ut enim ·
neminem alium nisi T. Patinam fa'mi-
liarissimum suum rogasset, scire potuit,’
etc„ and so also, if the subjunctive be read
there, Mur. - 34 ‘si ut suffragentur
nihil valent gratia.' Bentley, objecting
to the tautology of‘ut adsit,' ‘praesen-
tibus: 'would adopt ‘uti sit,' ⁶ non uti
being=‘n0n quo‚' ⁴ not that she could
give‚' etc. This was the reading of one
(it is not said the oldest) of Cruquius'
MSS, and he draws support for it from

, the unmetrical ‘ ut sit’ which is found in

several MSS. amongst which are φ, ψ, ἰι-,ιι .
The vulg. was interpreted by Porph.
Orelli suggests that the tautology isofa
