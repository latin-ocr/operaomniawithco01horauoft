ODE VI.

ιὃιῑινιἾΜιυε, my dmr friend who would accompany me to the ends of the earth,
let me spend the end of my life at Tibur, or if not there, then at Tarentum. Let us
go there together and live there till I die?

Septimius has been naturally supposed to be the same person whom Horace
introduces to Tiberius in Epp. 1. 9. The Schol. Cruq. further identifies him with

» '7 Titius, the poet on the staff of the same Tiberius in Epp. 1. 3. 9 ‘Romana brevi

venturus in ora, Pindarici fontis qui non expalluit haustus? ltmay probably be the
same person who is named as the common friend of the poet and the emperor in
Augustus’ letter preserved in the Suetonian life of Horace.

This is one of the Odes which is assigned by several of Horace’s ⁴chronologists
to a date earlier than 13.c. 31 (see Introd. to Books i-iii‚ ξ 2). We must not, perhaps,

'⁵ lay very much stress on the fact that the year ²9 is the earliest time at which we

know of public attention being called to the difficulty of subduing the Cantabri (v. 2);
but the positive arguments for the early date seem slight. If the words ‘lasso
maris et viarum militiaeque' are to be pressed (see note on v. Ι), they would carry
the Ode back not only beyond 31, but to a time when Horace was really fresh
-from his campaign, and before he could well have become familiar with Tibur and

“’ , · Tarentum. Macleane justly remarks that the tone of the Ode is not that of a

young adventurer freshly come to Rome to begin life. Nor is the argument

¹ '] stronger from the supposed incompatibility of his roving tastes with his pos-

session of the ‘unica Sabina‚’ which he obtained in rm. 34. Cp. his language in
Ep. 1. 7. 44 ‘mihi non tam regia Roma Quam vacuum Tibur placet aut imbelle

ν, Tarentum.’

order, to the three things of which the
poet professes to have had enough,
‘maris, viarum, militiae? This softens
the difficulty of which Orelli complains,
that Hmace should speak of himself' in
mature life as weary of toils which he
had long left behind him. The whole
line of thought has been ruled by his
imitation of Catullus. ‘You would go
with me anywhere, but don’t let us put
our friendship to such a test, we have
had enough in our time of wanderings
and fighting, we are growing old, let us
go to Tibur or to Tarentum.'
