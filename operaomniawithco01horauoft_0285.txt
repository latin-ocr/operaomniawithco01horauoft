‘ EviL omens are sor the evil. .1f Ι sear for you, I win at least wis‘h you all good
omens. Go, if you must go, and be happy wherever you are; and think of me

Europa didn’t know on what she was embarking‚ till she found herself on the seas

and saw nothing but sky and water. Then she repented bitterly, till Venus con-
soled her.'

It is possible that the conclusion of Europa's story loses its immediate point
from our not knowing the circumstances of Galatea's Journey. Was she too, as
has been suggested, to find consolation in the wealth and greatness of the com-
panion of her travel? There is· no passion, though there is tenderness and kindli-
ness, in the poet's feeling towards her. The Ode contrasts in this respect with the
similar poems os Propertius (1. 8) and Ovid (Am. 2. 1³).

In any case Horace meant people to read his Ode who knew nothing of Galatea,
and the story of Europa makes an artistic whole, even if, as is so often the case in
Pindar‘s mythological episodes‚ it only touches at one point the subject with which
the Ode begins. The story of Europa is told in Ov. Met; 2. 847 soll.
