LIBER. EPOD. 17. 369

EPODE XVII.

Horam—I yield‚ Canidia. I acknowledge your power ; cease your spells.
Achilles took compassion on Telephus, and gave back Hector's body to Priam’s
prayers. Circe restored Ulysses’ companions to their own form. You have
punished me enough. I have lost the hue os youth; my hair is white; 1 cannot
rest day or night. Ι deny the power of your spells no more, for 1 have felt them.
Spare me! Ο earth and sea, I bum with the fire of Nessus' poison or of Aetna.
When is it to end? 1 will do anything you ask; offer a hecatomb; tune my lyre
to falsehood‚ and sing of you as chaste and good. Stesichorus recovered his sight
on his palinode. You don't come of base parents3 you never plundered graveyards;
your heart is kind and your hands are clean; Pactumeius is your true son.

Canidia.-Y0u speak to sealed ears. Are you to escape scot sree after divulging
the mysteries of Cotytto and witnessing the witchcraft of the Esquiline, only to
make it the talk of the town? If you do I shall have wasted my labour. You
wish to die, but you shall live to suffer. Tantalus, and Prometheus, and Sisyphus
would like to be set free from their punishment; but they are not. There is no

, escape. The sword shall not pierce you, the noose shall not choke you. Ι will

 

ride in triumph on your neck. I can call the moon from the sky and raise the dead
from their urns. Do you think I can't deal with you ἰ’

Under the form of a recantation offered by himself and rejected by Canidia, he
repeats and aggravates the attacks upon her of Epod. 5 and Sat. 1. 8. Her witch-
craft is taken for granted by both speakers. New or more definite charges are
made against her, though they are put in the form ‘you did not,’ ete. She allows
every charge, and is angry only at their disclosure. The tone is more personal
than before. It is no longer Varus or some unnamed victim of her spesss, but
Horace (see esp. v. 58), and it gives an interpretation to the other two poems. If
they had stood alone we might have thought that it was a class, or a public folly,
that he was assailing. But here we can hardly doubt that we have a personal
enmity‚ involving more or less of real bitterness, and expressed under a form more
or less allegorical. It is impossible to read the riddle completely. Horace doubt-
less dramatizes imaginary situations, but it is not in his way to sustain an imaginary
character through three entire poems, besides making it the object of allusions in
several others. Cp. Epod. 3. 8, Sat. 2. 1. 48, 2. 8. 95, and see Introd. to Od; 1. 16.
This Epode is posterior to Epod. 5 and Sat. 1. 8, for it contains references to them ς
see vv. 47-5'2, 58.
