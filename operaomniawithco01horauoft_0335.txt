of his policy and hereditary transmission
of his same„win for him the glory that
Ennius’ poetry wins for him? The
truth, however, is perhaps that Horace
is (not consusing, but) consciously unit-

ἑ , ing the two Scipios. ‘What throws most

 

glory on the name of Africanus? Zama
‘and the destruction of Carthage, or
Ennius’ poetry?‘ ⁸ Eius qui. .rediit,’ is
merely a periphrasis for the name ‘Afri-
canus,’ and Horace could have used it

.* apparently of the younger Scipio, as he
uses of him in Sat. 2. 1. 65 the peri-

phrasis ‘ qui Duxit0ab oppressa meritum
Carthagine nomen.' · Cp. the words
which Cicero puts into the mouth of
Scipio Africanus Major.as addressed to
his grandson, ‘ Hanc [Carthaginem]
evertes, eritque cognomen id tibi per te
partum quod habes adhuc a nobis here-

s', , ditarium‚' Somn. Scip. '11. In favour of

this view is the fact already pointed
out, that the sentiment is really general,
‘famous deeds' are specialised, aster
Horace‘s manner, into ‘the deeds of the

’ ’ two Scipios,’ and 'poetry is specialised

into the poetry of (or such as that of)
Ennius; but',¹ we may remember that
Scipio’s exploits were only the last in
the long sen'es of glories which formed
the subject of Ennius' poem. That it
stopped short of Africanus Minoris a
fact that Horace might ignore.

15. fugae . . minae. The ssight of
Hannibal from Italy, and the return on
his own head, by Scipio’s invasion of
Africa, of the threats he had offered to
Rome by his invasion of Italy.

17. impiae3 4. 4. 46 ‘impio Poeno-
rum tumultu.'

20. Calabrae Pierides, from Rudiae,
a village of South Calabria, the birth-
place 'of Ennius.’

21. chartae sileant3 cp, 4. 9. 31.

22 foll. Instances from mythology of
the immortalising power ,οἱ poetry—-
Romulus, Aeacus, Hercules, the Tyn-
daridae, Bacchus.

22. Iliae Mavortisque puer, i. e.
despite his royal and divine aneestry.

23. taciturnitas invida3 cp. 4. 9.
33 ‘lividas Obliviones.’ Verses are
quoted from Ennius in honour of Rom-
ulus; but the thought is not limited to
any particular poem. ⁵ Rome itself, with
all its greatness and history, would not
tell us who Romulus was unless poetry
kept the legend alive?

26. virtus et, favor, generally taken
of the poet’s power and good will ; but
it is perhaps better to take them of
Aeacus: ‘His virtue and his popularsty.
and the poet's tongue.' ⁵ Et . . et ' will
imply that the last condition is at least
as necessary as the other two ; its posi-
tion and its reinforcement by the epithet
‘potentium‚’ ‘who can do so if they
will: give it pre-eminent importance.
Aeacus’ merits, like Romulus' birth,
only heighten our sense of the poet's
power, in that without it even they
would have been powerless.
