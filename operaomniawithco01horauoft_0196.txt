154 HORATII CARMINUM

ODE XVII..

¹ Km. me not, Maecenas, with your dismal forebodings. If you are going to die,
1 die too ; so the gods will, and so Ι will. For myself, I-could not survive the one
half of myself: I have sworn, and will be true to rny oath of' sealty3 where you go
1 will go, if the Chimaera or Gyas were to rise to prevent it. And the gods will ’
it too. I know not whether Ι was born under a good star or a bad one, but my

horoscope tallies wonderfully with yours. You recovered from dangerous inness· ’

just when I escaped the falling tree. Let us remember it, and in our several ways
thank the gods.’

Maecenas was an invalid (Plin. N. H. 7. 54 ‘Quibusdam perpetua febris est
sicut C. Maecenati. Eidem triennio supremo nullo horae momento contigit som-
nus ')‚ and one that clung passionately to life, if we may trust his own lines
preserved by Seneca, Epp. 101 :—

⁶ Debilem facito manu,
Debilem pede, coxa,

Tuber adstrue gibberum,
Lubrieos quate dentes;

Vita dum superest, bene est!
Hanc mihi vel acuta

Si ”sedeam cruce, sustine.’

He has been complaining of his health to Horace, and the poet would coax him
out of his hypochondriacal fears by the expressions of affection, by the professions
of his own strong belief that Maecenas’ life is as good as his own, by recalling his
previous recovery from illness and his flattering reception in the theatre, as
memories likely to strengthen his confidence in his destiny and in himself.

The astrological part of the Ode is only an adaptation of the lang-uage of a
popular superstition which Horace condemns in Od. 1. 11. Orelli points out that
the language of stanza 5, ‘ seu Libra seu‚’ etc.‚ sorbids the idea that Horace had
confidence in any calculation of his own horoscope. Hetells us, Sat. 1. 6. 114,
that he was fond of standing and listening to the astrologers of the circus. With
the poet's professions of his resolution not to survive Maecenas cp. Epod. 15 on
Maecenas' reception in the theatre, Od. 1. 203 and on Horace’s own escape from
the falling tree, Od. 2. 13.

Maecenas actually died in ne. 8, a few months before Horace.

CUR me querelis exanimas tuis?
Nec dis amicum est nec mihi te prius
Obire, Maecenas, mearum
Grande decus columenque rerum.

, 2. amicum est, φίλον ἐστι’. decus meum! Cp. Epp. 1. 1. 103, Virg-
prius, sc. ⁶ quam me? G. 2. 40.
