326 INTRODUCTION TO THE EPODES.

All the indications of date to be discovered in the poems them-
selves fix them to the first period of his life as an author. Their
. references to current politics, both positively, as in the allusions to the
war with Sextus Pompeius, and negatively‚ in the vagueness with
which they deal with the general situation at home (see on Epod.
7 and 16), belong to the decade between· the battles of Philippi and
Actium. We notice in their style indications which point the same
way—occasional harshnesses of construction, a redundancy of
epithets, a tendency even in the best poems to poetieal common-
place, we may add a grossness of subject and language, which his
mature taste would have pruned away. The Epodes stand with the .
Satires at the opening of Horace’s literary life——not unconnected
with them in tone, nor in their literary antecedents‚ nor in their>
treatment in his hands. The Roman Satirist, he tells us, looked„for
all but the poetical form of his composition,-to Greeleomedy. In
the Epode he has returned to the personal >lampoon, the earliest use v
of poetry for purposes of attack and caricature', and that of which

Comedy‚ according to Aristotle (Poet. 1. α), was the development„ ,-

It is in the taste which leads him for models to Lucilius and Archi--
lochus, rather than in any bitterness of special poems, that we may
trace probably his own description already referred to (Epp. 2. 2. 51 ;
see Introd. to Books i-iii‚ ξ 1) of the personal motives that firstdrove
him to write poetry. In any case it is characteristic of the man that
his Satires should mellow and humanize into the Epistles‚ and that
the Epodes should drop so earrly their ῖαμβικὴ ἰδέα, and soften and
generalize into the Odes. The process in both cases is vnearly
complete before the name of the composition is changed.

Horace speaks himself (Epod. 14) of the Book as preparing for
publication, and as having occupied some space of time in com-

position. The date of its publication is generally held to be fixed by -

the relation between Epod. 9 and Od. 1. 37, to the year 13.c. 31-30.
