Curas et arcanum iocoso 15
Consilium retegis Lyaeo,
Tu spem reducis mentibus anxiis,
Viresque et addis corn-ua pauperi
Post te neque iratos trementi
Regum apices neque militum arma. 20
Te Liber et, si laeta aderit, Venus
Segnesque nodum solvere Gratiae
Vivaeque producent lucernae,
Dum rediens sugat astra Phoebus.

16. retegis Lyaeo. The name of
‘Lyaeus' is used (as in Epod. 9. 38
. Dulci Lyaeo sol-
vere ’) with reference to its etymology,
λύειν, so that the whole sentence is=

‘arcana consilia retegendo curas solvis!
Cp Epp. 1. 5. 16· operta recludit! ‘The
cares of grave people that seemed heavy
burdens when brooded over alone, seem
subjects for mirth when confessed over
wine)

18. cornua, imit. by Ovid; see above.

, ’ They are the symbol of strength and of

pugnacity, Ov. Am. 3. 11. 5 venerunt
capiti cornua sera mero' ;perhaps also
with allusion to the ,fact that Bacchus
himself was represented with horus,
ταυρόκερωε; see on Od. 2.19.29.
19.postte;1.18.5‘post.vina.’
iratos apices=⁴irat01ffum see on
1.15.19. But there is an equal h y-pal
lage in making‘ apices' the object of

‘trementi’ The ‘apex’ (see on 1. 34.
14) represents the state and power os
an eastern king.

21. laeta, ἑκοῦσατ-πρόθυμοε, and so,
‘ with goodwill.’

22. nodum, sc. of clasped hands, or
of the concord which they express.
‘Gratia iuncta sororibus, ¹ 3. 19. 16.
Seneca, interpreting the characteristics
with which they appear in paintings‚
describes the Graces, Benef. 1. 3‘ mani-
bus ἱκῐιΡΙεκίε.Ι

23. vivae: ‘vigilesss 3. 8. ¹4·

produeent‘ te: an extension of the
ordinary‘ producere coenam‚' ‘comissa-
tionem!

24. dum . . fugat, ‘whilst he ιε put-
ting to rout‚' as though he were all night
striving to do so, and only victorious in
the morning. Cp. the tense in Virg. E.
9.. 23 ⁶ Tityre dum redeo, brevis est via,
pasce capellas.’
