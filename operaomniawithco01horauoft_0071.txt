as if the poet pointed to his delicate
wines and young Lycidas by his side;
but we could hardly say ‘regna vini

‘regna vini tui.’ So sar as ‘vini’ quali-

‘Wno is the delicate stripling now, Pyrrha, that is wooing thee? Poor boy!
disappointment is in store for him. Thy love is as the sea, as bright and tempstng,

’ and as treacherous. 1 was shipwrecked on it once, but I eseaped alive.'

1. multa in rosa, ‘in rosa’ might

ns mean ‘crowned with roses,' as Cicero’s

‘‚Pyrrha' πυ ῤ,ῥὰ ⁴—Golden hair,’ is enough
to shows if it were needful to show, that
it is a fictitious name.

5. simplex munditiis, ‘plain' in thy
neatness’ Milton. ‘Munditiae’ meant
a scrupulously exact tosset, not neces-
sarily excluding, but not requiring, any
adventitious adornment. The simplicity
of Pyrrha seems intended to contrast
with the lover's elaborate preparations
of himself and the grot3 the ‘liquidi

odores,’ ‘multa rosa,' ‘gratum antrum!
