HORATII CARMINUM'

Hic· dies anno redeunte festus q
Corticem adstrictum pice dimo‘vebit 10
Amphorae fumum bibere institutae
Consule Tullo.
Sume, Maecenas, cyathos amici
Sospitis centum et vigiles lucernas
Perfer in lucem: procul omnis esto 15
Clamor et ira.
Mitte civiles super urbe curas:
Occidit Daci Cotisonis agmen,
Medus infestus sibi luctuosis
Dissidet armis, , 20
Servit Hispanae vetus hostis orae ¹
Cantaber sera domitus catena,

9. hic dies, etc. ‘this day a holiday
in each returning year!

10. In order to ripen thewine sooner,
it was customary to construet the ‘apo-
theca ’ in such a place as to be exposed
to the smoke and hot air of the bath
furnaces. This rendered it more neces-

.sary carefully to protect the cork (as
here with a coating of piteh), lest the
flavour of the smoke should penetrate to

the wine. See Diet. Ant. s. v. ‘vinum.†·
11. bibere institutae, ‘which was-

taught the lesson of drinking.’

12. consule Tullo, probably L.
Volcatius Tullus, who was consul in
nc. 66, the year before Horace's birth.

Cp. 3. 21. 1 ‘O nata mecum Consule ”

Manlio? This was not an extreme age
(cp. 3. 14. 13 ‘Cadum Marsi memorem
duelli,’ i. e. as old as B.c. 88), and the
occasion demands ‘the oldest wine in the
cellar. Another L. Volcatius Tullus
was consul with Augustus in Bc. 33.
13. amici, the genitive of the person
in whose honour the cup is drunk. Cp.
3. 19. 9 foll. ‘Da lunae propere novae,
Da noctis mediae, da, puer, auguris
Murenae.’ The custom and the' con-
struction are Greek. Theoc. 14. 18
ἔδοξ’ ἑπιχεΐσθαι ἄκρατον “firmos ἤθελ’
ἕκαστος, ἔδει μόνον ὥτινος εἶπῆν. Orelli
quotes also Antiph. in Athen. 10. 21
κυάθρυε θεῶν τε καὶ θεαινῶν μυρίους. This
illustrates also ‘centum' sor an inde-
finite number. Macleane, referring to
the custom mentioned in Ov. Fast. 3.
531 foll. (‘Sole tamen vinoque calent,
annosque precantur Quot sumunt calices,

ad numerumque bibunt. Inv‘enies illicz
qui Nestoris ebibat annos, Quae-sit per
calices facta Sibylla suos‚'), thinks it is

equivalent to saying, ‘ wish me a hundred ι

years of life: ,

14. vigiles, to keep the banquet up
all night; 1. 27. 5, 3. 21. 23 -⁸ vivae
lucemae’ ς Virg. Aen. 9.-338 ‘Aequasset
nocti ludum in lucemque tulisset? Orelli -
contrasts the expressiones Ov. Her. 19.
195 ‘ iam-dormitante lucema.’

15, 16. ‘It shall be a sober and peace-
ful merrymaking’; no ‘ impius clamor,’
1. 27. 73 no ‘male ominata verba‚’ 3.
14. 11. The purpose is apparently to
make more alluring to Maecenas the
contrast from the tumults and troubles
of the city. Perhaps also to give some-
thing of a religious air-to the banquet of
thanksgiving. , ’

1 7. civiles = ‘domesticas' opposed to
the foreign questions os the following
lines.

super urbe; Virg. Aen. 4. ²33 ‘ Nec
ῗεξίεὲιῖῗῖέἓὲῃῗὲἶὲἳιῗζὲἓ ἶὺὲἓῗιᾴ
i-iii. § 8. ’

18. Daci Cothon-in see Introd. to ”
Books i-iii, ξ 7 >

19. Medus,'⁶the Parthian’; see on* ⁵

1. 2. 22. The point that the Mede's·
whole offensive power is exhausted on
himself in intestine quarrels is brought
out by the 'position of ‘sibi' standing
where it seems equally open to be μ
govemed by ‘infestus,’ ‘luctuosis,’ and

‘dissidet’ See on 1. ⁷3. 6.
