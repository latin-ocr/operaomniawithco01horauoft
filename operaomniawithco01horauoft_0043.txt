INTRODUCTION TO BOOKS I-III
OF THE ODES.

I.——THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE ODES.

§·1. Tm: general period during which the greater number of the
’ vOdes of Books i—iii must have been composed can be fixed with
J some certainty. The later limit will be discussed presently. The
, ‘earlier lz'mz‘t is fixed by the Battle' of Actium. Epod. 9 was written
- when the news of the victory first reached Rome, while even the
,¹ direction of Antony’s *flight was still unknown. Od. 1. 37 is written
. on Cleopatra's death in the following autumn, 13.c. 30.
It is of course possible that some of the Odes may have been com-
ζ posed before the Epodes were finished, but there is none that bears
’ any clear mark of it. Milman‚ who holds that some of the Odes must
.. have been among Horace’s earliest compositions, attaches much weight

· (Epp. 2. 2. 51), and which would have been his introduction to Virgil
and Varius, and their ground in speaking of him to Maecenasffiat. 1. 6.
’ - 54), must have been ‘ something better than one or two coarse Satires
¹ Α and perhaps a few bittcr iambics.' Franke, on the other hand, sees
- . in the first passage rather an explanation of the bitterness of his early
¹ Α writings, the writings of a man who had lost all he had and was angry
ἶ ·· with himself and the world, ‘vehemens lupus, et sibi et hosti Iratus
, J pariter, ieiunis dentibus acer‚’ l. c. v. 30. And for the second argu-
ment, Epod. 16, to which all Horatian chronologists give a very early
s Α ‚ date, would have given Virgil as good an idea of his disposition and
’ ’ν ’ poetical powers as any of the less important Odes. Franke's conclu-
ἶ sion is at least a safe one: ‘ Since there is no Ode which can be

’γ while I will not indeed assert positively that one or two may not pos-
