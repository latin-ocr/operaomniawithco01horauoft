was the name of a ⁸ collegium merca· who could buy everything so as to make
torum' at Rome, which was associated a profit, from old bronzes to estates:
with the ‘ cultus ’ of Mercurius, the god and here (Mercury being identified with
of traffic‚ Cic. ad Quint. Fr. 2. 5, Liv. the Greek Hermes) to himself, as under
2. 21, 27: the word was thus familiar to the special protection of the god who

O D‘E XVIII.

⁶1 mvn no ivoryv couches nor gilded ceiling nor rare marbles nor palace nor

crowd of retainers. Yet I have honour and wit and the respect of those richer

⁴ than myseff, and I am contented. You lay house to house as if you were to live for

ever. The land is not large enough, you must build in the sea. Nay, you must

pluck up your neighbour's landmark and drive out your own client to misery.

· ἢ Yet mo're surely than any house you are building the grave awaits you. Think of

. that Emit—'the grave, where you and your poor neighbours, oppressor and op-
pressed‚ are on an equality:

Horace opposes two pictures : one, of himself, contented and happy with his farm
and his poetry: the other, of some rich man so full of plans for building and in-
‘creasing his property as to sorget death and to commit wrong and robbery. Ode
15 complained of the great growth of the villas of the wealthy on the ground of
the waste of ground which was wanted for agriculture. This Ode t'ouches on
another evil incidental to this passion, the unjust and cr'uel ejection of sniall owners
from their ancestral properties. It is this which gives the special colour to the
usual satire on the folly of leaving death out of our calculations. Death is not
only more certain than all our plans—he is the great equalizer and redresser of
wrongs.

With the picture of the grasping proprietor compare Sallust's expressions where
. he is tracing that alienation of classes which led to the civil wars, Jug. 41 ‘ populus

militia atque inopia argebatum praedas bellicas imperatores cum paucis diripie-

bant: interea parentes aut parvi liberi militum ut quisque potentiori confinis erat
sedibus pellebantur!
ι· The early part of the Ode is not unlike in expression a fragment (28) of
1 Bacchylides :- ,
” οὔ βοῶν πάρεστι σώματ’, οὔτε χρυσός, οὔτε πορφύρεοι τάπητες, ἀλλὰ θυμὸς εὔμενὴσ
. Μοῦσά τε ’γλυκεῖα καὶ Βοιωτίοισιν ἐν σκύφοισιν οῒνοε ἡδύς.
