ODE Vss

‘Too long already, Augustus, art thou absent from thy trust. Return, then,
remembering thy solemn promise. Thy face is spring to the year and brightness
to the day. As a mother watches for her sailor-boy’s return, so Rome for her
Caesar. To thee we owe security by land. and sea; peace and plenty3 the restora-
tion of honesty and of pure morals. No sear of Parthian or Scythiam, of German
or Spaniard. From mor'n-till night a man works in his' own vineyard‚ and then
goes home to thank thee among the gods to whom he pours libations after supper.
Long be the happy holiday th'at Italy enjoys under thy auspices 3 such is our prayer
in the morning as well as in the evening.'
