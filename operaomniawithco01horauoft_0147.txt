Neu promptae modus amphorae,
Neu morem in Salium sit requies pedum,

Neu multi Damalis meri

Bassum Threicia vincat amystide,

Neu desint epulis rosae,

Neu vivax apium, neu breve-lilium.

Deponent oculos, nec Damalis novo

for which the Greeks called fuller's earth
Κιμωλία ’γῆ (Ar. Ran. 71 3, Ov. Met. 7. 463
‘Cretosaque rura Cimoli') from Cimolus,
one of the Cyclades, whence they
obtained it. He pointed out that where
he is writing ‘ sermoni propiora: he calls
it simply ⁸ creta'; S. 2. 3. 246 ‘Creta an
carbone notandi.' Horace is referring
to what was doubtless merely a prover-
bial mode of expression among the
Romans. Pliny attributes it as an
actual custom to a Thracian tribe, ⁴ quae
oe‘lculos colore distinctos pro experi-
mento cuiusque diei in urnam condit ac
supremo die separatos dinumerat atq'ue

³ ita de ‘quoque pronunciat,’ N. H. 7. 40.

ΤΙιε Latin poets are full of allusions to
such a fancied symbolic practice. Cp.
Mart. 12. 34 (where he is reviewing his
thirty-four years of intercourse with his
kinsman Jul. Martialis) ‘ Quarum 'dulcia
mista sunt amaris, Sed iucunda tamen

J. fuere plura: Et si calculus omnis huc et

illucDiversus bicolorque digeraturVincet
candida turba nigriorem.' For brieser
references, Catull. 68. 148 ⁵ Quem lapide

· 'illa diem candidiore notat’; 106. 6 ‘ Ο

lucem candidiore nota'3 Pers. 2. 1
⁴ Hunc Macrine diem numera meliore
’ lapillo? Some early critics altered
⁸ Cressa’ to ‘ Thressa: on the ground
apparently of the story in Pliny. The

„ schol. justify ‘ Cressa ¹ by relating the

same story of the Cretans ; but, as
Bentley remarked, whether they were
Thracians or Cretans they used black
stones as well as white, so that the

’ epithet would not imply the colour of
Β 2 the stone to be used.

. must be brought out (⁸ cellis depromere

avitis,’ od. 1. 37. 5), and when brought
there must be no stint of it.

1. 244, or more probably the aecus. of
the adj. ‘ Salius‚' which occurs in Fest.‚
and which Horace (see on Od. 1. 15.
10) would have been likely to prefer
to the longer ⁴ Saliaris3' Dancing was

20), and according to Ovid (Fast. 3.

387 ‘a saltu nomina ducta ¹) was the ’,-

origin of their name.

13. multi meri, imitated by· Ovid‚
Met. 14. 252 ‘multique Elpenora vini.'
Cic. ad Fain. 9. 26, describes a man as
‘ hospes non multi cibi, sed multi ioci!
It is an extension of the descriptive gen. .
‘ pusilli animi,’ etc„ Madv. ,ξ 287, with
obs. 3. Bassus, whose usual character
is clearly intended to contrast with that
os Damalis in this respect, is on this
occasion to rival her in taking deep
draughts of wine, ἀμυστί, i. e. without
closing the mouth = ἀπνευστί.

14. Bassum. The Roman name
almost implies that a real person is
intended. There was a Bassus a poet-
ical friend of Ovid (Trist. 4. 10. 47), and
one (or two) contemporary with Cicero;
but none is known to us whose date
would well suit this reference. By
Martial's time the name has from this
passage become proverbial sor a hard
drinker (Mart. 6. 69).

Threicia, cp. Callim. Fr. 109 καὶ γὰρ
ὁ Θρηΐκίην μὲν ἀπέστυγε χάνδον ἄμυστιν
ζωροποτεῖν. Orelli recalls Hector’s
taunt to Rhesus the Thracian (Eur.
Rhes. 405), οὐκ ἐν δεμνίοις πυκνὴν ἄμυ-
στιν ὡε σὺ δεξιοῦμενοι. For the Thra-
cian habits, see on Od. 1. 18. 8.

16. vivax, breve. Merely for the
pleasure of the antithesis, cp. Od. 2. 20.
9. 11 ‘ asperae, leves.' ‘ Breve,' ‘ short-
lived‚' as ‘ breves flores rosae,’ Od. 2. 18.
13. The flowers are for garlands for
the guests.

1 7. putres = ‘ lascivos?

18. novo, sc. Numida.
