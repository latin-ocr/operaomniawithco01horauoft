35⁶⁷ HORATH EPODON

EPODE XL

‘I mvn no heart for poetry. A different passion has smitten me. 1 am the
victim of Love in a way that no one else is. Three years ago it was Inachia. 1
was the talk of the town : my moody ways, my loud complaints that she preferred
money to merit, my resolutions to free myself‚ aud my repeated return to slavery.
Now it is another. Neither advice nor rebuffs will cure me. The only relies that

I can look for is some new passion:

Horace, as Ritter remarks, turns the sting of his iambic verse, in profession at
least, upon himself. We know no more of his friend Pettius (or Pectius as some
MSS. spell it), to whom the Epode is add-ressed. ·

Metr-e—-Archilochium 111m.

PETT1‚ nihil me sicut antea iuvat
Scribere versiculos amore percussum gravi,
Amore, qui me praeter omnes expetit
Mollibus in pueris aut in puellis urere.
Hic tertius December, ex quo destiti 5
Inachia furere, silvis honorem decutit.
Heu me, per Urbem—nam pudet tanti mali—
Fabula quanta fui! Conviviorum et poenitet,
In quis amantem languor et silentium
Arguit et latere petitus imo spiritus. ιο
Contrane lucrum nil valere candidum
Pauperis ingenium? querebar applorans tibi,

2, versiculos, the diminutive gives a
touch of ironical contempt, as in Sat. ’1.
10. 58.

amore percussum, probably a re-
miniscence of Lucretius, 1. 9²2 ‘ acri
Percussit thyrso laudis spes magna
meum cor, Et simul incussit suavem mi
in pectus amorem Musarum‚‘ coloured
perhaps by Virgil’s imitation, G. 2. 476
‘ingenti percussus amore’ ; so that
‘amore‚’ made emphatic by its repeti-
tion, and explained in v. 4, has the soree
of a ‘passion‚ vehement and irresistible,
but not for the Muses.'

3. expetit urere, for the prose ‘ quem
urat!

6. honorem decutit, Od. 1. 17. 16
‘Ruris honorum‚’ Virg. G. 2. 404 ‘Fri-
gidus et silvis Aquilo decussit honorem‚'

see Conington’s note there. Servius
says that that line is borrowed from
Varro Atacinus; if so, Horace may

have taken it from the same source. ¹

7. nam pudet, the reason for his
exclaiming ‘heu me: etc„ not for the
fact which he states in his exclama-
tion.

8. fabula, ‘a topic of talk: Epp. 1.
1 . .

313. arguit. the perfect tense.

11. contrane . . valere, Madv..§ 399,
Virg. Aen. 1. 39 ‘Mene incepto desistere
victam‚' and so too Cicero, Rosc. Am.
14 ‘ Tene tibi partes istas depoposcisse’ ἲ
It expresses surprise and indignation.

12. applorans, ‘wailing with some

one to listen.’ The word only occurs Ἴ

here and once in Seneca.
