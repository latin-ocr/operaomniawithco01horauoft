LIB. 11. OD. 4.

And possibly the Ode refers to some real person, although the name be fictitious.
The irony would be wasted on a shadow3 and there is a definiteness both in the
, name of the ‘ Phocian ’ Xanthias and in the introduction of Horace’s own person-
ality (stanza 6), which is more dramatic than is usual in the purely imaginary
odes. It is undoubtedly Horace's way to add a local desig-tration to fictitious
characters: ⁴ Cnidius Gyges,‘ Od. 2. 5. 203 ‘ Liparaei nitor Hebri,' 3. 12. 6. In
some cases, as in ‘Thurini Calais filius Omyti,' 3. 9. 14, the appearance of com-
plete identification is strongly in point, and in all the object probably was to give
a greater semblance of reality. The purpose here is the less easy to imagine, from
the fact that the name is addressed to Xanthias himself, not used by way of iden-
tifying him to others. If the lover of the Ode was a real person, there may of
course be some play in the name, of which the point is lost to us. Orelli suggests
that ‘Xanthias’ may be chosen to cover a Roman ‘F lavius‚’ cp. Od. 3. 15. 11,
where he thinks ‘Nothus' may represent a real ‘ Spurius! Ritter imagines a
Greek resident in Rome, and, comparing Od. 1. 27. 10 ‘ Megillae frater Opuntiae‚'
ingeniously suggests that the person there rallied is none other than Xanthias‚ and
that the ⁸ Phyllis ¹ of this Ode is the ⁴ Charybdis ’ of that; see Introd. to 1. ²7·
The composition of the Ode is fixed by v. ²4 to the end of Horace's fortieth
year, nc. 25·

2. 403 foll. ‘ Ecce trahebatur passis
Priameia Virgo Crinibus a templo
Cassandra,’ etc. Thereis an antithesis
between ‘ medio in triumpho ’ and ‘ vir-
gine rapta '3 ‘ capta victorem cepit.’
It is this feeling which gives its point to
the next stanza. ⁴ When the warriors

had fallen and the eitadel of Troy

was an easy prey to its foes, then a
captive maid vanquished the great
conqueror!
