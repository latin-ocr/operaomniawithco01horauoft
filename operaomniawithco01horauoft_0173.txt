⁸ No, Barine, if you ever suffered in the least degree for forswearing yourself, 1
would believe your oaths now; but you thrive on it, and only become more beau-
tiful and more popular. The gods who ought to punish you only laugh. Fresh
lovers crowd to you, and the old ones, in spite of your faithlessness, will not for-
sake you.'

whole stanzaful of offered eonditions.
