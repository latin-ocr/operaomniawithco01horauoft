142 HORATII CARMINUM

O D E XIII.

Tun thoughts suggested by the fall of a tree on his Sabine farm from which
Horace narrowly escaped. For other allusions to the incident see Od. 2. 17. 27,
3. 4. 27, 3. 8. 8; and on the date of all the odes which refer to it see Introd. to
Books i-iii, ξ 8.

The poem begins with a burst of indignationjat least half humorous (comp.
Epod. 3), at the unlucky tree and the wretch that planted it. Then, from the
mention (v. 12) of the accident that had so nearly overwhelmed him, n‘ses the
thought, ‘ How little we guess the quarter from which danger roelly threatens us.
We fix our eyes on some one risk and sear that only, but death comes to all the
world from the quarter they do not expect? Next, suggested by the ‘leti Vis
rapuit rapietque‚' comes the remembrance how very near to death he hasbeen,
⁸ how near seeing Proserpine and Aeacus on his seat of judgment and the separate
abode of happy souls, among them' (here comes the last change) ‘ thos‘e whom the
lyric poet would first look for, Sappho and Aloeeus. An admirIng throng of
shades is round both, but the larger and the more attentive round Alcaeus. What
wonder if they listen, when even Cerberus is spen-bound, and Prometheus and Δ
Tantalus forget their pains, and Orion stays from his hunting to hear!

ILLE et nefasto te posuit die,
Quicunque primum, et sacrilega manu
Produxit, arbos, in nepotum
Pemic‘rem opprobriumque pagi ς’

of Horace's indignation is the man that
planted the tree, so that ‘ille’ stands
fitly in the place of emphasis in both
stanzas. ‘Quicunque primum’ has in-
craesed force for its parenthetical posi-
tion ;— Ι don' t know who he was or

. primum. The object sore equally ‘nefasti’; but by an error
which A. Gellius notices (Noet- Att.
4. 9), the epithet was vulgarly restricted
to those which were interdicted sor
business as ‘tristi omine infames! In
the poets and post-Aug. prose ‘ nefastus ’

how long ago it was (the tree had fallen
from its age), but 1 can tell sor certain
the character both of the man and of

‘illum’ (‘illum et‚’ Heins.; ‘illum o,’
Bentley; ‘illum‚’ Buttm.), which makes
the whole sentence down to ‘pagi'
relative with ‘ quicunque ’ for its subject,
‘illum’ only anticipating the next
staua, really weakens instead of
strengthening. There is no MS. autho-
rity for any change.
