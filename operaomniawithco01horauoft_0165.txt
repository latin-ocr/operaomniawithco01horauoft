ODE V.

⁸ Limon is not old enough for your advances. Let her be a child a little longer.
Have patience, she will come to you by and bye, and return the love greater than
you ever gave to Pholoe or Chloris.'

‘ Incertum est quem alloquatur hac Ode utrum amicorum aliquem an se ipsum,'
Aer. Even if it be a soliloquy‚ the poet may be addressing himself ‘in an assumed
’ character, as e. g. in Od. 3. 12. The Zurieh MS. of the 10th century (τ) has the

 

- -supposed to have had reference to any real persons.
The main image of the ode is one, as Dillr. says, ‘in antiquitate usitata,
a nostris moribus aliena.’

NONDUM subacta ferre iugum valet
cervice, nondum munia comparis
·‘ Aequare nec tauri ruentis
In venerem tolerare pondus.2
Circa virentes est animus tuae 5
Campos iuvencae, nunc fluviis gravem
Solantis aestum, nunc in udo
Ludere cum vitulis salicto
Praegestientis. Tolle cupidinem
Immitis uvae: iam tibi lividos > 10
Distinguet Auctumnus racemos ³
Purpureo varius' colore.

„⁴ 11, 12. distinguet . . colore. Is

this merely the effect of Horace's collo-
cation, ‘ streak the bunches with purple,'
‘varius,' the epithet of autumn, ‘the
money-coloured? being placed between
those words which most recall the
character which the epithet expresses?
or does he, while meaning ‘ distinguet
purpureo colore? allow ‘ purpureo
colore’ as a matter of grammar and
primary sense, to go rather with ‘ varius ⁹
as a description of personified Autumn
‘ streaked with purple dyes‚’ like Epod.

Autumnus agris extulit’?
