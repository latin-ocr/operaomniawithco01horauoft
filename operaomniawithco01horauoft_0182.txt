mannen see on 1. 3. 19. Numantia was
taken, after its long resistance, by Scipio
Africanus Minor, in B. c. 133. Numan-
tia, Hannibal, and the sea-fights of the
First Punic War, stand for Roman wars
generally.

Α 2. durum, so the great majority of
MSS. Bentley compares Virg. G. 3. 4
⁴ Eurysthea durum,’ and points out that
there is a Horatian antithesis between
it and the ‘ molles citharae modi! Orelli
follows earlier editors in altering it on
very slight MS. authority to ⁶ dirum,’

§athe epithet of Hannibal in Od. 3. 6. 32,

pne dictum id est quo nihil invemri

- Siculum mare. This name. which
is generally given to the sea to the east of
Sicily, is used by Horace of the sea
between its north coast and Italy; see
3. 4. 28 ‘Sicula Palinurus unda.’ The
chief victories referred to will be those
of C. Duilius in 13.c. 260 off Mylae, on
the north coast near Messina‚ and of L.
Lutatius Catulus in 242 off the Aegates

5. nimium mero, ‘overcharged with
wine.’ Cp. ‘fiducia nimius‚’ Sall. Fr.;

Cp. Od. 1. 18. 8 ‘Centaurea . . cum Lapi-

contremuit, with accusative, as Virg.
Aen. 3. 648 ⁴ sonitumque pedum vocem-

que tremisco.’ For the implied com·
parison of Augustus and his enemies to
Jupiter and the giants see Od. 3. 4. So
the ‘ fulgens contremuit’ has point as
expressing the greatness, magnificence,
of the interests threatened.

9. tuque pedestribus. This gives
a second reason why Horace should not
attempt the theme. It would not suit his
‘iocosa lyra
better in prose. For ‘que’ in such a
case see on 1. 27. 16. Notice the em·
'phatie position of the words which im-
ply the double opposition between
Horace and Maecenas. lyric try
and prose. Orelli remarks that 1332oe
is the first of extant Latin writers to
translate the Greek πεζός (Arist. Fr. 713,
Plat. Soph. p. 237 A πεζῇ τε καὶ κατὰ

ις. ζει· vias, ‘through the streets of
Rome‚’ i. e. in a triumph.

12. oona, cp. Prop'. 2. 1. 33 (the
whole poem presents parallels to this
Ode) ‘Aut regum auratis circumdata
colla catenis, Actiaque in Sacra currere
rostra via! So Epod. 7. 7 ‘Intactas
aut Britannus ut descenderet Sacra caxe-
natus via.’

minacium, so V;' and most of
the good MSS. have either this or,
what is only a miswriting of it, ‘mina-
tium.' From this probably arose the
corruption found in a few, ‘ minantium!
Bentley suggests as a parallel for that
reading, Ov. Trist. 4. 2. 21 foll. ‘vin-
claque captiva reges cervice gerentes
Ante coronatos ire videbit equos: Et
cernet vultus aliis pro tempore versos,
Terribiles aliis immemoresque sui’3 but ⁷
he prefers the vulg. himself. and quotes
Od. 2. 7. 11, where ‘ minaces’ is used in
just the same contrast; ‘that just now
threatened so high:
