HoRATu CARMINUM

Merses profundo: pulchrior evenit: 65>
Luctei‘e: multa proruet integrum

Karthagini iarn non ego nuntios

particular story, for Echion wasone of
the five of the Sparti who survived the

’ζ mutual slaughter; Ov. Met. 3. 126.

65. merses, ‘plunge it if you will·.'
For the construction cp. Epp. 1. 10. 24.
Some good MSS. (including Bern.) have
the corruption ‘ mersus‚’ which, as Bent-
ley points out, is impossible, since ⁶ gens’
must be the subject. Ritter thinks this

line and the next have a definite histor· ’

ical reference to the disasters of the
Romans by sea in the First Punic War,
and on land in the Second, and their
subsequent'recovery in each case. With
the thoughts of the stanza compare the
sayings attributed to Hannibal by Livy
(27. 14), ‘ cum eo nimirum hoste res est

qui nec bonam nec malam ferre fortunam ,

potest. Seu vicit, ferociter instat victis:
seu victus est instaurat cum victoribus
certamen: and by Justin. 31. 6 ‘cum
Romano seu occupaveris prior aliqua
seu viceris tamen etiam cum victo et
iacente luctandum esse.’

evenit, so all the good MSS. ξ Exiet:
which Orelli accepts from very little
MS. authority, in order to harmonise
with ‘proruet' and ‘geren' is a form
of the future unparalleled in any clas-
sical writer. There is more MS. au-
thority for converting the other verbs
into presents; but this only shows that
the difference of tense was felt as a
difficulty.

66. multa cum laude, ‘amid loud
applause,' of a feat in a wrestling match.
It is also taken with ⁴ integrum,' ⁶ with

· all his laurels.'

a.. integrum‚⁴ fresh‚' ⁶ with all his powers
unbroken.’ We have to understand
from ‘integrum victorem‚’ that the sub-
ject of the sentence, on the contrary, has
just been thrown.

68. coniugibus loquenda. It is

hard to say' whether this is to be taken,
with Orelli, of their own wives, ‘ sor
their wives to tell of,’ i. e. in pride; or,
with Ritter, of the Carthaginians’ wives, ἡ
‘which only wives will live to tell of,'
the husbands being all slain. The latter
gives a more definite climax to the

stanza ; but it must be allowed that if ’ ’

this is the meaning, we should have

expected some word to imply either that ι
the ‘wives‘ would be widows, or that “

their ⁴ talk ¹ would be by way of mouru—
ing. Catullus puts the idea more dis-
tinctly, ⁴ Illius egregias virtutes claraque
sacta Saepe fatebuntur gnatorum in
funere matres,’ 64. 349.

69. iam non . . superbos, as after
Cannae. Cp. Livy's account of Mago's
mission to Carthage to announce that
victory, and carry the proof of it in
three bushels of gold rings taken from
Roman knights, 23. 12.

72. Hasdrubale interemptm Liv. ’
28. 12.

73—76. 1t is a question whether· the . .

stanza is a continuation of Hannibal's
speech or the poet’s summing up. The
latter seems more likely. A quiet ending
of the Ode is part of Horace’s art (see
Introd. to Books ri-iii, § 11. 3), but he
would hardly put into Hannibal's mouth
a dull prophecy os the glories of the
house os Nero. It is pretty certain, also,
that Ritter is right in supposing that
the ‘ curae sagaces ⁹ belong to Augustus.
Cp. 4. 14216 and 32 ⁴ Te copias, te con—
silium et ‘tuos'Praebente Divos.' Ho-
race's intention is to unite the praises
of th*e emperor with those of the young
N eros. Here the compliment is inten-
sified by the conjunction os his protec-
tion and that of Jupiter. This is the
only interpretation which will give the ¹
last line and a half sufficient weight to
