o D E XXX11.

“Tm call on us for a song. Come, my lyre, Ι have drawn strains from thee
before which, light though they be, will not soon die: answer now with such
music sor Roman *ears as thou yieldedst of old to Alcaeus. He was a patriot and a
warrior, yet amidst his wars and shipwrecks he found time to' sing of wine and
love. O lyre, the delight of gods, the solace of toil, help me too whenever 1 duly

” call on thee.’

1t is not unlikely that the Ode refers to some request of Augustus or Maecenas
sor a poem of a graver cast: Ritter thinks the six stately Alcaic Odes which stand
at the beginning of Book iii. There is an appearance of reality in the appwl
of the first stanza, and in the pains which he takes to point out that Iyrics on
3< Lycus' black hair were not inconsistent in Alcaeus’ case with civic zeal and
soldierly courage. It is written, like Od. 1. 1, 2. 20, 3. 30, when Horace had
become easy as to his own powers and their recognition by the world. See,
however, on v. 1. ’ ·

Latinum, sor it is a Greek lyre that
is called upon to give music to Roman
ears. Horace is ‘ Romanae fidicen lyrae.’
Od. 4. 3. ²3· The main antithesis is
contained in the words ‘Latinum,' ‘Les-
bio,' helped also probably, as Dillr sug-
gests, by an antithesis which might be
felt between the Greek and Latin ‘ bar-
bite,' ‘carmem‘ See on Od. 1. 1. 34.
