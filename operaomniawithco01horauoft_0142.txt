HORATII CARMINUM

Te pauper ambit sollicita prece 5'
Ruris colonus, te dominam aequoris,
Quicunque Bithyna lacessit> ’
Carpathium pelagus carina.
Te Dacus asper, te profugi Scythae, -
Urbesque gentesque et Latium ferox ιο
Regumque matres barbarorum et
Purpurei metuunt tyranni,
Iniurioso, ne pede proruas
Stantem columnam, neu populus frequens*
Ad arma cessantes, ad arma 15
Concitet imperiumque frangat.

5. pauper. There seems to be sug-
gested a double opposition, the rich and
the poor, the landsman' and >the sassor,
though, after Horace’s way, each clause
has to borrow something to complete
the antithesis from the other. ⁸ Pauper
ruris colonus ’ implies its converse, the
riches of the tradem ‘dominam aequoris’
is meant to suggest that she distributes
also the treasures of the country.

7. Bithy-na, perhaps rather, like
‘Cypria trabe: Od. 1. 1. 13, as coming

from or trading to Bithynia, a seat of

commerce, Od. 3. 7. 3, Epp. 1. 6. 33,
than as built of Bithynian timber. ‘ Pon-
tica pinus,’ Od. 1. 14. 11.

lacessit, ‘tempts,' as though the sea
were a wild beast which it was dan-
gerous to go too near3 ‘non tangenda
vada,' Od. 1. 3. 24·

8. carpathium, the ,sea between
Rhodes and Crete, named from the
island Carpathus. Like ‘ Bithyna ’ it .is
merely a special name for a general.
There is a point, however, in naming
as many comunes, and those as distant
from one another, as may be.

Scythians who, if attacked, retreat into
their boundless steppes. These again,

to insist on the universality of Fortune’s

men from it. This is brought out
equally by the antithetical form of v. 9

and by ‘the quick accumulation of copu-
latives ιη vv. 10-12.

11, 12. The mothers of eastern
princes sear sor their sons, as Atossa for
Xerxes (cp. Od. 3. 2. 7), and princes in

the midst os their splendid state sear fot ·

lious,' Epod. 17. 33. 7

ne . . neu, not two different ‘dangers3
the second is only one form of the dan-
ger metaphon'cally described in the
first clause.

14. columnam. The pillar seems to
be purely metaphorical as an emblem
of stability. Cp. the metaphor in Aesch-
