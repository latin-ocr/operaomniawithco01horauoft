Tm: Fortuna of this Ode, as has been alreadytsuggested, is a different conception
from that of the last. She is the author of the vicissitudes of life, but not in sport
(as in Od. 3. 29, 49), or at random‚ as the blind chance-goddess. The apparent
capriciousness is that of ahidden will, and its decisions have the fixity of fate.
Through any confusion of image in vv. 21-28 (see on v. ²4) the thought seems
clear, that her attributes are moral. ‘Her frown does not dri've away hope nor
extinguish any but mercenary affection-⁸ Her purposes are moral, and the great·
nass of Rome is amongst them. This gives their relevancy to the later stanzas.
⁸ The rule of Caesar· is the cessation of civil bloodshed, the restoration of religion,
v the turning of Roman arms to their legitimate aim of conquering the world.
Therqsore Fortune is invoked'to protect him and his plansl

One of the chief conceptions of Fortune to a* Roman was the ‘ Fortuna
publica: ‘Fortuna populi Romani,’ the Fortune described in Plutarch's image
² (de Fortuna Romanorum, c. 4): ‘ even as Aphrodite, when she crossed the Eurotas,
laid aside her mirror and her ornaments and her cestus,> and took spear and shield
to adorn herself for Lycurgus’ eyes, so when, after her sojourning with Persians
and Assyriam, with Macedonians and Carthaginians, she (τύχη) approached the
Palatine and crossed the Tiber, she laid aside her wings andx took off her sandals
and left behind her ball, the symbol of fickleness and change.'
