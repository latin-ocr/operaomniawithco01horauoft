HORATII CARMINUM

9. bis Monaeses et Pacori manus.
Three defeats of Roman armies by the
Parthians are recorded—that of Crassus
at Charrae by Surenas, 30. 53 ; that of
Decidius Saxa, legatus os M. Antony,
in Syria by Pacorus the son of Orodes,
and Labienus the republican renegade,
in n.c. 40; and that of M. Antony in
Media in uc. 36. Pacorus himself had
been killed in battle in nc. 38. The only
Monaeses known to history was the Par-
thian noble who, having fled, like many
others, from the tyranny of Phraates IV
(the son to whom Orodes 1· 111 1115 gn'.ef
at the death of Pacorus had resigned
the crown), instigated Antony to his
ill advised mv asion of Parthia 111 Β. c 36.
lt has been sugg ested that Monaeses
may have been the name of the general
who defeated Crassus, ‘Surenas’ being
not so much a name as a title, as it
appears to have been certainlya' m later
times. Σουρήνας. 3de52 δὲ τοῦτο παρὰ
Πέρσαις ὄνομα, Ζο51111115 (Α.1).400-45ο).
Esne would cut the knot by condemn-
ing the stanza. Probably Horace is
thinking of the two greater deseats—of
Crassus and Antony—and Monaeses and
Pacorus· are merely representatives of
the Parthians.

10. non auspicatos (in some good
Μ88.’ inauspicatos '). Bentley objected
to the series os accusatives as prosaic,
