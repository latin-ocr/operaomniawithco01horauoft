. ΤΙιε protection from common dangers accorded to the poet’s flocks is extended ’
- to himself. As a child, ‘non sine Dis animosus,‘ he is covered by the wood-
⁴ pigeons from the snakes and bears of Mount Vultur (Od. 3.,4). Mercury snatches
⁵ him from the folly and danger of 'civil war into which his boyish enthusiasm had
carried him (Od. τι. 7). Faunus (Od. 2. 17) wards off from him the falling tree.
Now a wolf flies from him as he wanders unarmed in the woods near his Sabine
’ sarm. ’

zl‘Urbis amatorem Fuscum salvere iubemus Ruris amatores.' ‘ Fuge magna,

,‘ ’the critics by whose judgment Horace will abide, in S. 1. 9, as the friend who
,wickedly escapes, leaving the poet ⁴ sub cultro? He is called by Aer. on Epp.
’ 1. ιο ⁶ scriptor tragoediarum,’ by Porph. ‘ comoediarum: by both, on S. 1. 9, ‘ gram-
·. maticorum doctissimus‚’ but nothing is known of him from other sources.
