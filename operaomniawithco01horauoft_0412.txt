HORATII EPODON

Per et Dianae non movenda numina,

Per atque libros carminum valentium

Refixa caelo devocare sidera, ἐ 5
Canidia, parce vocibus tandem sacris

Citumque retro solve, solve turbinem.

Movit nepotem Telephus Neretum,

In quem superbus ordinarat agmina

Mysorum et in quem tela acuta torserat. ιο ’
Unxere matres Iliae addictum feris

Alitibus atque canibus homicidam Hectorem,
Postquam relictis moenibus rex procidit

Heu pervicacis ad pedes Achillei.

Setosa duris exuere pellibus γ 15
Laboriosi remiges Ulixei

Volente Circa membra3 tunc mens et sonus
Relapsus atque notus in voltus honor.

3. non movenda. ‘that may not be
provoked’; Od. 3. 20. 1 ‘Non vides
quanto moveas periclo, Pyrrhe, Gaetu-
lae catulos leaenae Ῥ

4. carminum, os magic formulae3
Epod. 5. 72, ete.. Virg. E. 8. 6772.

5. refixa, pred„ ‘to draw the stars
from the skies and bring them down’;
Virg. Aen. 5. 527 ‘caelo ceu saepe refixa
Transcurrunt . . sidera.' Conington re-
marks that the stars are viewed as nails
that stud the sky.

6. vocibus sacris, ‘mystic words’;
Epod. 5. 76 · Marsis voeibus.’

7. retro solve, ‘let it loose, that it
may run bazk.'

turbinem ῥόμΒον. the wheel. which
was one of the instruments os a magi-
cian. Theocritus gives a meaning to its
spinning 2. 3ο ‘ns δινεΐθ’ ὅδε ῥόμὲοε ὁ
χάλκεος, ἔξ Ἀ ῥραδίταε ’ἓΩς τῆνος δινοΐτο
ποθ’ ἁμετέρῃσι θύρν, σιν.

8. movit, ⁴ moved to pity.'

nepotem Nasium, as the son of
Thetis. Telephus had been wounded
by Achilles. and the oracle declared that
he only who had wounded him could
cure him.

11. unxere; Virg. Aen. 6. 218, of
the' honours paid to the body os Misenus.
⁰ corpusque lavant frigentis et unguunt.’
Some good MSS. have ‘luxere'3 but,
besides the preponderance of MS. au-
thority. ⁴ unxere ' answers better to ‘ ad-
dictum alitibus’: it expresses more

definitely the fact which is the real '
point. viz. that they recovered the body,
though Achilles had declared that they
should not have it. ⁸ Luxere ⁹ would at
least involve an ambiguity. even if it
admits, as Bentley argues. the sense of
formal mouming over the body.

addici-,mm 11. 23. 182 Ἕκτορα δ’ οὔτι
Δώσω Πριαμίδην πυρὶ δαπτέμεν, ἀλλὰ
κίινεσσιν.

12. homicidam, a translation oi
ᾲνδροφόνοε, Hector's epithet in 11. 1.
242 and elsewhere.

13. Hom. 11. 24. 510, of Pn‘am before
Achilles, ’κλαῖ’ docui προπάροιθε ποδῶν
Ἀχιλῆος ἐλυσθείς.

14. heu pervioaeiu Od. ι’. 6. 6
‘cedere nescii.’ The exclamation em-
phasises the epithet: ⁴ We reprobate
obstinacy even 1n him, yet he yielded.'
O÷elli takes it rather as·refer1ing to the
whole sentence ‘ad indignitatem saed?
to the thought οἱ Priarn ‘holdin the
knees and kissing the hands) δειι ἆν-
δροφόνουε αἵ οἱ πολέας κτάνον vtas.

15-18. Ritter points out that the last
place is reserved for Circe, as coming
nearer home to the witch Canidia.

15. The construction is. · membra se·
tosa pellibus.' i.e. the shapes os swine,
‘with bristlffi on their hard hides!

16. laboriosi, genitive case; Epod.
