OD. 1. 17

Dis miscent superis, me gelidum nemus 30
Nympharumque leves cum Satyris chori
Secernunt populo, si neque tibias

Euterpe cohibet nec Polyhymnia

Lesboum refugit tendere barbiton.

Quodsi me lyricis vatibus inseres, 35
Sublimi feriam sidera vertice.

membered rather than created. It is
appropriated here and elsewhere by a
Roman poet with a feeling that it de-

’ scribes his art also. It is on a know-

ledge and imitation of Greek models
that Horace rests his own title to fame.
The lute which his muse strings is the
‘lute of Lesbos.’ ,,
, hederae. The ivy crown belongs to
the poet (Virg. E. 7. 25, 8. 13) as in-
spired by Bacchus; cp. Juv. 7. 64 ‘do-
minis Cirrhae Nisaeque‚’ Hor. Epp. 1.
19. 4.

30. Dis miscent superis, not merely
like ‘evehit ad deos' above—⁴ glorify
me, make me as happy as the gods,’ but

5⁷- ‘admit me to a happy dreamland,’ to

the Μουσῶν νάπαι, the ‘ pii luci ’ of Od. 3.

⁴ 4. 5 soll.; cp. 3. 25. ἰ foll.

32—34. tibias . . barbiton. The two

> instruments are intended to include all

varieties of lyric poetry; see on Od. 3.
4. 1—4‚ and cp. 1. 12.. 1, 2. They are
divided here between Euterpe and Poly-
hymnia. In the two passages referred
to they are both· attributed in one case
to Calliope, in the other to Clio. In 1.
24 and in 4. 3, Horace traces his inspi-
ration to Melpomene. He knows no-
thing of any division amongst the Nine

of the different branches of poetry.
For the plural ‘tibias,’ cp. Od. 4. 15.
30, Epod. 9. 5, and see Dict. Ant. S. v.
The reference is to the double pipe—two
pipes used at the same time—one of
a hIgher the other of a lower pitch.
Cp. Herod. 1. 17, where the αὐλοὶ άν-
δρήϊοι καὶ γυναικήῖοι are generally in-
terpreted in this way.

34. Lesboum barbiton. The Greek
form of adj. and subst. seems to point·
to the imitative character of the poetry
which he aspires to write: see on Od. 1.
32. 3, and on 4. 6. 20. It is to be no·
ticed that Horace prefers in the Odes
the Greek form Helenen, Cypron, etc„
in the Satires and Epistles the Latin
Helenam, etc.

35. vatibus. The Greek lyric poets
-for on Horace’s showing they had as
yet no Roman rival. Cp. Od. 4. 3. 13,
and note the change of tone. He there
claims as his own, by gift of the public
voice, the place which here he looks for
at the hands of a patron.

36. feriam sidera. Ι shall be raised
to the skies with glory. A common
Greek trope. Sapph. Fr. 9 :patiar δὲ
πόλον δοκεῖ μοι οὔρανῶ δυσπάχὲα. So ph.
O. C. 381 πρὸς οὐρανὸν βιβῶν.
