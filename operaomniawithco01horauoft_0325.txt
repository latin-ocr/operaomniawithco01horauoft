Quis Parthum paveat, quis gelidum Scythen, 25
Quis Germania* quos horrida parturit
Fetus, incolumi Caesare? quis ferae
Bellpm curet Hiberiae? .
Condit quisque diem collibus in suis,
Et vitem viduas ducit ad arbores ; 30

Defuso pateris et Laribus tuum
Miscet numen, uti Graecia'Castoris 35
Et magni memor Herculis.

the Sygambri : see Introd. to the Book.
horrida, in reference both to the

seems to imply ‘breeds in swarms’

34. Laribus. ⁶ This worship of Au-
gustus, or rather, perhaps, of the Lar of
Augustus, as a demigod or genius, is to
be distinguished from the later cult of
the Caesars as denies, which Augustus
himself interdicted at least in Rome‚'
Merivale, vol. iv, ch. 33, p. 75. See ib.

of the chapels-and worship of the Lares,

35. Castoris. The genitives were

probably felt to be dependent both on

“ ‘numen ' and on ⁶ memor.' If we must

choose between them, doubtless Orelli
and Dillr. are right in preferring ⁶ memor’:
‘ like Greece in her pious recollection o‘f
Castor, ' etc.

uvidi, βεβρεγμένοι. The whole: ‘at

‘all hours andin all conditions'; perhaps

with a remembrance of such sayings as
that of the Persians‚ who, according to
Herodotus (Ι. 133), deliberate on every
important matter twice, μεθυσκόμενοι
and νήφοντεε.
