10 INTRODUCTION TO THE ODES. ,

simplicity and light-heartednesa stands at the end of a. long Book as-

well as immediately after the high-pitehed Ode on Cleopatra.

Instances where we may see certainly the love of variety, very
possibly an undertone of irony, are the position of ‘ Quum tu Lydia
Telephi: after 1. 12, and that of ‘ Quid fles, Asterie?' after the stately
Odes that begin Book iii. The mere desire to change the key is well
exemplified in 1. 24, 25 and 3. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

4. If 1. 38 has a fitness at the end of a Book, we may note a
similar fitness for their place in 2. 20 and 3. 1. The adaptation
indeed of these two Odes to their position was doubtless what sug-
gested the now abandoned theory of a separate publication of Books
i, ii, and Book iii. That theory can really derive no support from
them, for it would necessitate, as we have seen, an entire rearrange-
ment of the Odes in a chronological order, in the course of which all
evidence would disappear of the position of these two Odes as well as
of all the others.

5. The hand of a conscious arranger must surely be seen in the fact, ,¹

that Odes 1-9 of Book i contain‚ with three exceptions‚ one of
which is made good in the 11th Ode, representatives of all the metres
employed in the Three Books. We may compare with this the
obviously metrical disposition of the Epodes 1-10, 11—16, 17, and the

regular alternation of Alcaics and Sapphics through more than half
of Book ii of the Odes.

6. Where definite contrasts are not required, we may see from time
to time in the selection the working of the opposite principle of
associaffion, sometimes in a general similarity of subject as between

2. 13, 14 ς 3. 9—12: sometimes in some accidental phrase or thought -

which seems to recall another poem to the arranger, and guide
his hand to it, as in 1. 17, where Cyrus’ tipsy brawls seem to
suggest the Ode which follows on the moderate use of wine; 1. 34,
where the mention of Fortune, even though in a different sense or
point of view, is a link to the following Ode to Fortuna Antias; 3. 17,
where the invitation to keep holiday, with which the Ode ends, sug-
gests the special holiday picture of the Faunalia in 3. 18.
