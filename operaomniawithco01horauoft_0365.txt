HORATII CARMEN SECULARE.

Quaeque vos bobus veneratur albis
Clarus Anchisae Venerisque sanguis, 50
Impetret‚ bellante prior, iacentem ’
lenis in hostem!
Iam mari terraque manus potentes
Medus Albanasque timet secures,
Iam Scythae responsa petunt, superbi 55

Nuper, et Indi.

Iam Fides et Pax et Honos Pudorque
Priscus et neglecta redire Virtus
Audet, apparetque beata pleno

Copia cornu.

Qui salutari levat arte fessos

49. quae veneratur. ‘Veneror’ is
used os prayer, as in Sat. 2. 2. 124, Virg.
Aen. 3. 460; here, as in Sat. 2. 6. 8 ‘si
veneror stultus nihil horum‚' with an ac-
cusative of the thing ptayed for. There
is another reading of less authority,

- ⁸ quique,’ with ‘ imperet‚’ ‘ may he rule ’

(absol.), in v. 51.

bobus albis. The modal ablative
would suit ‘veneror’ in its usual sense
of ‘ to do homage to' (cp. e. g. Virg.
Aen. 5. 745), better than in its new
sense of ‘ to pray! For the occasion of
the sacrifice see Introd.

50. sanguin Od. 2. 20. 6, 3. 27. 65,
4. 2. 14.

51. bellante prior. This is part of
the prayer, a picture of what Augustus
desires to be, the picture drawn by An-
chises in Virg. Aen. 6. 852 ‘Parcere
subiectis et debellare superbos!
ti0i⁴533331232d32²52¹12³33{¹3⁴} Ϊέζῗῗὲἶ
4. 5. 6, 4. 14. 42. Epp. 1. 18. 56.

Albanas secures, the fasces, the
emblem of Roman rule. ⁴ Alban' be-
cause of the connection of the origin of
Rome with Alba. It is not quite the
same as Virgil's ‘Albanique patres,'
Aen. 1. 7; see Conington in loc.

55. responsa. This would be the
usual word for any reply given to an

embassy sent with a request or reference,
asin Liv. o. 38 ‘ sine responso legatos
dimisit: Standing here alone, without
mention of the ⁶ legati‚’ it is meant prob-
ably to draw a more poetica] colour

from its use of the answers of gods, '⁸

oracles, etc.; cp.‘Virg. E. 1. 45 ‘Hic
mihi responsum primus dedit ille petenti!
For the sact see on Od. 4. 14. 42. The
visit of the Scythian and Indian ambas-
sadors took place while Augustus was
wintering in Samos, aster Tiberius' pro-
gress in Armenia in Β. c. 20. Some
stories are told of the Indian embassage
by Dio 54. 9.

60“. cornu3 see on Od. 1. 17. 16.

65. si, with the indicative apodosis
(see on v. 68), must=‘ if, as doubtless
he does.'

amas, This was the reading of V,
and was found by Porph.‚ who interprets
‘ si acceptas aras habet quae in Palatio
dedicatae sunt? It is given by Keller
and Mr. Munro. B. supports the vulg.
‘ arces'; see on Od. 2. 6. 22.

66. felix, better taken with ‘ Latium,’
as Dillr. and Ritter, th an with ‘ lustrum,'
as Orelli. It is not Rome and Latium
that Apollo will prolong, but ‘ the state
and power os Rome and the happiness
of Latium7’ It is still very likely that, as
Orelli suggests, Horace remembered the
