196 HORATII CARMINUM

«O 'D E VII.

⁸ Don'r weep, Asterie, for your absent Gyges, He will come back to you with
the spring and bring a wealthof Bithynian merchandize. He will come back:
he is only detained by the winter in the harbour to which he was driven on his
way home. He lies awake at.night thinking of you. It is all in vain that his
hostess Chloe· tries every art to win him, sends emissaries to tell him of her
passion and to prove to him from mythology the folly of constancy3 he turns
a deas ear to it all. Only mind you do as well. Your neighbour Enipeus is a -
brave young gallant, but don‘t open younwindow if he comes to serenade you.’

As Orelli characterizes it, ‘ εἷδύλλιον mercatorum vitam amoresque lyrice descri-
bens: The names are Greek, the life Roman. Ritter points out the effect os this

Ode in relieving by its lightness and grace the seriousness of the preceding six.
Compare the position of Od. 1. 38.

Post insana Caprae sidera frigidas
Noctes non sine multis
Insomnis lacrimis agit.
