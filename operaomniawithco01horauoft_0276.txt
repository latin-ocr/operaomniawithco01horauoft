234 HORATII CARMINUM

O D E XXIV.

⁴ chrms and luxurious abodes can stay neither care nor death. The Scythians
live more wisely, with no settled homes, no stores of wealth. They have not the
vices of civilized life. Their women do not poison their step-children, nor rule
their husbands, nor break their marriage vows. Who would be known as the
saviour and father of his country? Let him check the licence of the time. He
may be hated by his contemporaries, but he will be glorious toan ages. It is no
good to complain :—punish the offenders :-no good to make laws, while our lives
give the lie to them, while we scour sea and land for the sake of money, and think

poverty the one shame. Let us get quit of our wealth: root out the evil if we are' ⁷

really tired of it, and train our sons in a manlier school. Let them hunt instead
of playing with the Greek hoop and the dice, while their fathers are cheating to
heap up money {or them, their unworthy heirs. That is the way wealth grows ς and
it is an endless business, for it never can keep pace with desire?

The Ode travels over the same ground as Odes 1-6 of this Book, which seem in
fact expansions of texts from this one. It must have been written about the same
time, though probably before them. We may note also how many of its expres-⁶

sions reeur in the Odes (especially 5 and 15) of Book iv, which celebrate Augustus' .

acts as accomplished.
