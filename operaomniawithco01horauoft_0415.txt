LIBER. EPOD. 17. 3²73

Tibi hospitale pectus et purae manus,
Tuusque venter Pactumeius, et tuo 50
Cruore rubros obstetrix pannos lavit,
Utcunque fortis exsilis puerpera.
Quid obsera-tis auribus fundis preces?
Non saxa nudis surdiora navitis
Neptunus alto tundit hibern-us salo. ¹ 55
Inultus ut tu riseris Cotyttia
Volgata‚ sacrum liberi Cupidinis,
Et Esquilini pontifex venefici
Impune ut Urbem nomine impleris meo?

 

Quid proderat ditasse Pelignas anus, 60
Velociusve miscuisse toxicum?
Sed tardiora fata te votis manent:

after death, τὰ ἔνατα. We are depend-
ent for our information chiefly on the
Scholiasts upon this place, upon Virg.
Aen. 5. 64, and Terent. Phorm. 1. 1. 16,
and they differ in their accounts of the
employment of the intervening days,
But all agree that the ninth day was the
one on which the dead was finally put
out of sight.

50. venter=‘partus.' The allusion
is to the taunt in Epod. 5. 5.

Pactumeius Orelli shows to have
been a Roman name. It occurs in the
consular lists of the two first Christian
, centuries. =

52· fortis exsilis, of her speedy re-
covery. Intended to retract the retrac-
tation.

56, 59. ut . . ut; Madv. ξ 353 obs.
Of something not to be thought of,
whether as improbable or as offensive;
Cic. Cat. 1. 9 ‘ Quamquam quid loquor?
Te ut ulla res frangat. Tu ut unquam
te corrigas.’ lt more often has an inter-
rogative particle added 3 Hor. Sat. 2. 5.
18 ‘ Ut ne tegam spurco Damae latus'?

56. riseris volgata, i. e. ‘ volgaveris
et riseris.’

Goryaia, licentious mysteries cele-
brated in Thrace, and later in Athens
and Corinth, in the name of a goddess
Cotys or Cotytto. Canidia gives this
name to the dark rites described in
Epod. 5, with their lustful purpose.

58. pontifex. A ‘ pontifex ’ had the
right and duty of being present at all
sacred rites, and of seeing that they

were duly performed. Horace has
acknowledged in Sat. Ι.Ί 8 his cogni-
sance of Canidia's (loings on the Esqui-
line. She turns the tables on him. He
was there as a very master in the art,
and yet has held her up to public scorn.
Orelli quotes the title which Cicero
gives Clodius on account os his unlaw-
ful presence at the rites of Bona Dea,
pro Sest. 17 ‘stuprorum sacerdotem.'

60—62. ⁴ What profit, then. were it to
me [i.e. if you could do this with im·
punity] to have made the fortune of
Pelignian hags [i.e. to have paid sor
learning every secret of magie], and to
have mixed the speediest poison? But
[though Ι (10 not mean tolet you off.
and though I call my poison speedy]
the fate that awaits you is all too slow
for your desire.’ The text is that of the
Beme MS, and is defended by Bentley,
Orelli, Rstter, and Dillr„ and it gives
the best connection of thought. There
is, however, good MS. authority for ‘pro-
derit' in v. 60, and sor ‘si' against ‘sed' in
v. 62. The question must then be re-
moved to the end of v. 62, and the sen-
tence will refer to Horace, not to Cani-
dia, ‘ What will it profit you richly to
have paid Pelignian hags (i. e. to find
spells that might free you from me), or
to have mixed the quickest poison (i. e.
in order to kill yourseff), if a sate awaits
you too slow for your desires.’

61. velocius, sc. ‘ solito!

62. tardiora answers verbally to
⁴ velocius!
