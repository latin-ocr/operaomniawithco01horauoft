24 HORATII CARMINUM

Sic fratres Helenae, lucida sidera,
Ventorumque regat pater
Obstrictis aliis praeter Iapyga,
Navis, quae tibi creditum 5
Debes Virgiliur'n, finibus Atticis
Reddas incolumem, precor,
Et serves animae dimidium meags
Illi robur et aes triplex
Circa pectus erat, qni fragilem truci 10

Od. 1. 5. 15 ‘potenti maris deo': 1. 6.
10 ‘musa lyrae potens.’ He is address-
ing Venus (⁸ marina,’ Od. 3. 26. 5, 4. 11.
15); she was worshipped at Cnidus
under the name of εὐπλοία, Paus. 1..1. 4.
Cp. Ov. Her. 19. 160 ‘ Auso Venus ipsa
favebit, Sternet et aequoreas aequore
nata vias.’

2. fratres Helenae, ‘ Castor and
Pollux,’ Od. 4. 8. 31 ‘ Clarum Tyndari-
dae sidus ab infimis Quassas eripiunt
aequoribus rates.' Cp. 1. 12. 25 foll„
3. 29. 64. They were especial protec-
tors of sailors‚ who saw their presence
in the electric lights which are said to
play about the spars of a vessel at times
after stormy weather in the Mediterra—
nean, and which are now called St.
Elmo’s fire. It is these, and not the
constellation Gemini. that are the ‘lu-
cida sidera.’ Cp. Statius Pro. Met. Cel.
8 ⁴ Proferte benigna Sidera, et antennae
gemino considite cornu.’

3. regat, for the number, see on v.
10.

pater, ‘ Aeolus,’ from Hom. Od. 10.
213 cp. Virg. Aen. 1. 52.

4. aliis, ‘all others,' cp. Sat. 1. 10.
77‚an uncommon use, but found even in
good p1·ose; ‘ vulgus aliud trucidatum,’
Liv. 7. 19. lt is perhaps rather in its
sense of ἀλλοῖος than os ἄλλος, ⁴ those of
other kinds!

Iapyga, ‘albus Iapyx? Od. 3. 27. 20.
The N.W. wind, which got its name in
the mouths of those who crossed from
Brundusium to Dyrrhachium, on whom
it blew from the ⁶ Iapygium Promonto-
rium’ in Apulia, and to whom it was
Ι the most favourable wind.

6. finibus Atticis, ‘ambiguum ut-
mr‘n “ debes finibus Atticis'' an “ finibus
Atticis reddas‚‘” Porph. It is really
governed ἀπὸ κοινοῦ, as grammarians
say. by both. This is a construction
. which Horace often adopts sor the sake

of brevity, and to avoid clumsy and
unmanageable pronouns and particles.
Compare the position of ‘ consiliis' in
Od. 2. 11.11; os ‘sibi' in 3. 8. 19; of
⁴ cantare’ in Sat. 1. 3·-²· The metaphor ¹
of a ‘depositum’ (Stat. l. c. 5 ‘Grande
tuo ‘rarumque damus, Neptune, pro'-
fundo Depositum’) is sustained through
the words ‘ creditum,’ ‘debes‚’ ‘ reddas’;
with ‘ incolumem' the ‘ safety' of virgil
becomes again more prominent than
the ‘ entireness ’ of the repayment.

8. et, ‘and so.’ It couples two de-
scriptions of the same action, first in its
relation to Virgil, then in its relation to
Horace, cp. 2. 2. 10, 4. 13. 10.

animae dimidium, ‘ secundum illam
amicitiae definitionem φιλία ἐστὶ μία
ψυχὴ ἐν δυοΐν σώμασιν,’ Porph.; Call.
Ep. 43 ἥμισύ μευ ψυχῆς ἔτι τὸ πνέον,
ἥμισυ δ’ οὐκ οἶδ’ εἴτ’ Ἔρος εἴτ’ Ἀΐδης
ἥρπασε, πλὴν ἀφανές. Cp. Od. 2. 17. 5
‘ te meae partem animae? .

9. robur et aes triplex. The ori-
ginal of this and other expressions of
the kind is the Homeric σιδήρεος θυμός,
11. 21. 357: σιδήρειον ἦτορ, 24. 205.
Jani took the words as=‘r0bur aeris
triplicis‚’ quoting Virg. Aen. 7. 609
⁶ aeternaque robora ferri’ But the ae·

cumulatiori ‘oak and triple brass‘ is .

like Aesch. P. V. ²42 σιδηρόφρων τε κάκ
πέτρας εἰργασμένου cp. Od. 3. 16. 2
‘ turris aenea Robustaeque fores.’
common both in Greek and Latin to
put the two things conjunctively. rather
than as alternatives; cp. Hector’s wish

for Paris, Il. 3. 40 εἶθ’ ὄφελες ἄγονός ’ ¹

τ’ ἔμεναι ἄγαμός τ’ ἀπολέσθαι. See on
Od. 3. 11. 49.

10. erat. It is common in Horace ·

to find a singular verb with two or three
subjects where all, or the one nearest
to the verb, are singular. Bentley gives
a list on Od. 1. 24. 8 ⁸ Cui Pudor et
Iustitiae soror Incorrupta Fides nudaque

Itis ”
