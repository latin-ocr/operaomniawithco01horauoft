7. pro curia, ‘the senate,’ as in 2. ι.
14 ⁸ consulenti curiae? The force of
⁸ inversi’ is thrown back upon ‘ euria¹
after Horace’s manner: see on 1. 2. 1,
cp. 1. 5. 5. ‘fidem mutatosque Deos.’
‘ The senate is changed, and the whole
spirit of morals and discipline, of which
it was the guardian, is overset.’ · Com-
pare the part played by the senate in

the subsequent story of Regulus, v. 45. -

8. socerorum, plural, as Hom. Il. 3.
49 νυὸν ἀνδρῶν αἰχμητάων, and Theocr.

umis. So the MSS. with only one
exception, and the reading is illustrated·
by Justin’s account of the practice of
the Parthians, 41. 2. 5 ‘exercitum non
ut' aliae gentes liberorum, sed maiorem
partem sewitiorum habent,' and by the
story (quoted by Merivale from Flor. 4.

ἒ 10,'and Ven. Patere. 2. 82) of the as-
, ‘sistance rendered to the expedition of

M. Antonius hyp Roman in the Par-

* thian ranks, ‘ qui clade Crassiani exer-

citus captus . . fortunam non animum
,mutassetff Canter’s conjecture, ‘arvis,’
·was warmly supported by Bentley. It
has since been' found in one MS. of no
great antiquity. There is force in
Bentley's argument, that Horace’s in-
dignation is moved not by Romans hav-
ing borne-arms against their country,
‘ quod falsum· et inauditum: but by
their consenting to live and marry
among their eaptors, ‘obliti Romani
nominis.’ Τὴε charge seems, vv. 25,
30, 31, 36, to be rather that they are
cowards than renegades. In the pre-
sence, however, of the MS. testimony
hg has not persuaded many of the
e itors.

9. sub rege, ‘invidiosum apud Ro-
manos nomen,' Orell.

Marsus et Apulus. The Marsi (cp.

2. 20. 18 ‘ qui dissimulat metum Marsae
cohortis') are distinguished by other
wn'ters. as Virg. G. 2. 167 ‘ genus acre
virum Marsos! The Apulian is named
as a fellow countryman of the poet3 see
on 1. 22. 13.

10. anciliorum, as if the genitive of
‘ancilium'3 so ‘ vectigaliorum,' Suet.
Aug. .c. 101. 'For a collection of similar
cases see Macrob. Saturn. 1. 4. The
‘ancile' was one of the pledges of the
eternity of Rome. For the legend of
its descent from heaven, and for the
meaning of the plural ‘ ancilia‚’ se‘e Ov.

13 foll. ¹ It was this danger which

ι Regulus had foreseen when he coun-

selled the senate not to ransom himself
and his sellow captives? The danger
which he foresaw was, that isthere were

,the hope of ransom, Roman soldiers

would come to prefer captivity to a
brave death. Now they had come to
acquiesce in it, so much as even to
forget their own country.

15. trahentis=‘derivantis.’ ‘ Trac-
ing the stream of ruin that would flow
to future ages from the precedent, if‚‘

etc. No exact parallel for the phrase ’

‘perniciem trahere’ in the sense os ‘to
trace the stream of ruin’ has been

alleged3 though the metaphor of the -

stream is common enough, as 3. 6. 19
¹ Hoc fonte derivata clades In patriam
populumque fluxit’; but as we say of
one who points out a ‘ derivation’ that
he ‘derives‚’ so in Latin the idea of
actually drawing a stream passes easily
