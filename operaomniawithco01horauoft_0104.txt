62 HORATII CARMINUM

Quis non te potius, Bacche pater, teque, decens Venus?
At, ne quis modici transiliat munera Liberi,

OEtaurea monet cum Lapithis rixa super mero

¹ Debellata, monet Sithoniis non levis Euius,

Cum fas atque nefas exiguo fine libidinum 10

Discernunt avidi.

Non ego te, candide Bassareu,

Invitum quatiam, nec variis obsita frondibus
Sub divum rapiam. Saeva tene cum Berecyntio

κροτεῖν, of rattling or tiresome talk,
S. 2. 3. 32 ⁴ si quid Stertinius veri cre-
pat’; Epp. 1. 7. 84 ‘Sulcos et vineta
crepat mera ’ 3 A. P. 247 ‘immunda cre-
pent ignominiosaque dicta.’ So that it
can only be used with the, next verse by
a zeugma.

6. decens, Od. 1. 4. 6.

7. at, so of recent Editors, Keller,
Orelli, Ritter, and Dillr. Cruquius
reads ‘ at ' without mentioning any v. l.,
which is perhaps evidence that he found
it in his Blandinian MSS. B, and all
tenth century MSS. (except r, which has
‘aut') have ‘ac‚' and Bentley follows

xthem. But the passages which he
quotes, Epp. 1. 1. 13.1. ¹9· 26, 2. 1. 208,
do not require an adversative as strongly
as this transition from the use to the
,abuse of wine.
i modici, ‘ that loves moderation,'
‘verecundum Bacchum,' Od. 1. 27. 3.
. 1t would properly be the epithet of the
dmught, δε δ’ ἂν ὑπερβάλλῃ πόσιος μέ-
τρον, Theogn. 47, or of the proportions
of the mixture, see on Od. 1. 20. 1.
transiliat, see on 1. 3. 24, ‘lightly
to overpass the bounty of Liber,' δῶρα
Διονύσου, is not to be content with what
the god allows us, but to take more
‘invito De0,’ v. 11.

8. centaurea. For this story, see
Ov. Met. 12. ²19 soll„ and cp. Hom.
Od. 21. 295 οἶνος καὶ Κένταυρον ἀγακλυ-

θόντ’; Virg. G. 2. 455 foll. ⁸ Bacchus et

Centauros leto domuit‚' etc.

super mero. Ritter takes ‘ super,' of

,place‚ over the spilt wine; Orelli, of

{respect=‘ de,' as ‘civiles super urbe

Αζ curas‚’ Od. 3. 18. 17. In the legend, how-

ever‚wine is not the ground of the quar-

,ἶ rel. Dillr. thinks that Virgil's ‘ nocte
super media‚’ Aen. 9. 61, will justify us
in taking it os time, ⁸ after!

9. debellata, see on Od. 1. 3. 13.

 

Sithonii& properly the inhabitants
of the middle finger of the three which
run out into the Aegean srom Chalci-
dice. F or Thracian intemperance, cp.
Od. 1. 27. 1, 1. 36. 13, 2. 7. 26.

9, 10. ‘ There is waming in the heavy
hand of Evius on the Sithonians, when
in their greedy haste they divide right
and wrong by the slender line of their
own appetite,' i-e. when the only dis-
tinction they place between right and
wrong is that they desire the thing or
not. .

11. candide, ⁴ ever fair and ever
young‚' of the bright beauty of divine
youth3 Epod. 3. 9 ‘ candidum ducem,'
of Jason.

Bassareu, a name of Dionysus from
βασσάρα, a Thracian word for a foxskin
worn by the Bacchants. Horace puts
‘ I and those who agree with me will
be moderate in the use of wine,’ into
language taken from the Bacchic mys-
teries. ‘ 1 will not lay 'an irreverent or
untimely hand on thy rites.’ “

12. quatiam, properly applied to
the thyrsus, and perhaps to the solemn
lifting of the sacred -‘ eista,’ which con-
tained the emblems of the god, ‘ com-
