384 INDEX OF METRES.

θεοῖσιν, ‘ Ille mi par esse deo videtur.' The lengthening of the short ’
syllable in 2. 6. 14, ‘Angulus ridet, ubi non Hymetto‚’ is perhaps
a trace of the feeling that, as the first syllable of the dactyl, it had the
metrical accent upon it.

The caesura falls commonly, in the first three Books‚ after the fifth
syllable, ‘Iam satis terris,’ though it is found, from time to time, after
ι, the sixth, ‘Quem virum aut heroa.' In the Carm. Sec. and the
Ἴ Fourth Book, Horace returns in this point to the use of Catullus and
the Greek, and employs the second caesura frequently. In either the

three Sapphic Odes of Book Four together, or in the carm. Sec.
alone, there are twice as many instances of it as in the twenty-one
*Odes of the earlier Books.

There is no synaphea, but hypermetric syllables are occasionally
elided at the end of all the first three verses of the stanza (2. 2. 18, 2.
16. 34, 4. 2. 22, 23, C. S. 47). By Sappho the Adonic was treated
as if it scanned continuously with the verse before, and this use is
preserved in Horace to some extent, a word being at times divided

between them (1. 2. Ι9,- 2. 16. 7). On the 'other hand, we Ι

find a hiatus at times, as in 1. 2. 47 ‘Neve te nostris vitiis iniquum
Ocior aura! ’

ξ 4. Iambz‘c metres.

Of these two occur in Horace :—-

(1) The common Senarius or Iambic Trimeter (for the name
see Ars Poet. 252) in Epod. 17.

(2) Couplets of the Senarius and anIambic Dimeter in Epod.
1-10.

Horace does not observe the law of the Greek Tragic Senarius in
respect of a short syllable before a final cretic 3 see e. g. Epod. 1. 27
and 29. γ ’

Three instances occur of an apparent anapaest in the fifth place:
Epod. 2. 35 ‘laqueo,’ 5. 79 ‘inferius‚’ 11. 23 ‘mulierculam’; but
Meineke rightly explained them as instances of synizesis, or using
e and z' as semivowels, after the analogy of ‘aurea’ in Virg. Aen.
1. 698, and of ‘consilium’ and ‘principium’ in Od. 3. 4. 41 and
3. 6. 6.

§5. These metres account for 97 out of the 104 Odes (including. the
Carm. See), and 1 1 out of 17 Epodes.
Of the remaining metres‚ one or at the most two or three

specimens exist, which are to be viewed rather, as Mr. Munro
remarks, as experiments.

5. Alcmam‘um, Od. 1. Α7 and 28, and Epod. 12.
