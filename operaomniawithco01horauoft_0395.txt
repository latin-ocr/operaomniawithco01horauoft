Hostiliumque navium portu latent
Puppes sinistrorsum citae. 20
Io Triumphe, tu moraris aureos
Currus et intactas boves?
Io Triumphe, nec Iugurthino parem
Bello reportasti ducem, ,
Neque Africanum, cui super Karthaginem 25
Virtus sepulcrum condidit.
Terra marique victus hostis punico
⁴ Lugubre mutavit sagum.
Aut ille centum nobilem Cretam urbibus
Ventis iturus non suis, 30
Exercitatas aut petit Syrtes Noto,
Aut fertur incerto mari. - ’

name as a war cry. The Scholiasts
quote Virg. Aen. 7. 698 ‘Ibant aequati
numero. regemque canebant.'

19, 20. These lines obviously describe
some naval defection whichq's matehed
with the desertion of the Galatian
cavalry. The meaning of ‘sinistrorsum
'citae' has not been sully explained.
Bentley suggested that ‘ puppim ciere,’ =
‘to put the stem in motion,’ may have
been a Latin equivalent of πρύμναν κρού-
εσθαι, ‘to back water‚’ and that ‘sini-
strorsum’ may have had some technical
meaning as a completion of the phrase;
or that Horace may be speaking as one
who looks at the scene of war from the
north, so that ‘ to the left’ would mean
‘ eastward,’ i. e. into the Ambracian
Gulf.

-21. io Triumphe. ‘Triumphus’ is
personified, as in Od. 4. 2. 49, see note
there. There is an emphasis on ‘tu,’
‘It must be the Triumph-god himself
that delays the starting of the proces-
sion, all else is ready.'

22. intactas, ‘never yoked,' and so fit
for sacrifice3 ‘intacta cervice iuvencas‚’
Virg. G. 4. 540, ‘grege de intacto
mactare iuvencos? Aen. 6. 38.

2 5. Africanum, sc. ⁴ reportasti parem
ducem.' The ‘ monument which his
valour built for him on the ruins of
Carthage' is a metaphorical monument.
Vell. Paterc. may have had these lines
in mind when he wrote of Scipio Afri-
canus Minor ‘ eam urbem funditus sus-
tulit fecitque suae virtutis monumentum
quod suerat avi eius clementiae.' The
reading ⁶ Africano,' sc. ‘ bello,' found in

some good MSS. seems to have arisen
from a desire to make the construction
of the two clauses more symmetrieal:
‘ sepulchrum condere bello’ in the sense
of ‘ finem facere bello,' is hardly an Hora-
tian metaphor; and, as Bentley remarks,
‘ Africano' is not a distinctive epithet
enough for the war, we need ‘Punico.‘
The Jugurthine war was equally in
Africa. The Scholiasts interpret ⁴ super‚'
‘over against,' and have a mythical
story of an oracle desiring Scipio’s
bones to be removed from the Vatican
hill (they would have been in the tomb
of the Scipios on the Via Appia, not on
the Vatican) to a tomb at Ostia, ‘ over
against Carthage.'

27. punico, a less usual form of
⁸ uniceo.‘ Either scarlet or white was
t e proper colour of the ‘paludamen-
tum‚' or general’s cloak.

28. sagum was the cloak of the com-
mon soldier on service, opp. to ‘toga,’
the dress of a citizen; as understood
with ‘punico’ it loses its special sense.
For the construction of ⁶ mutavit’ with
the accusative of the thing taken, see on
Od. 1. 17. 1. “

29, 32. Three conjectures as to An-
tony’s ssight. He is gone to Crete or
to Africa, or he is beating about on the
sea. All these are qualified by words
to express his helpless state. If he
wishes to go to Crete he cannot com-
mand the winds: the Syrtes are ‘still
vexed’ by the south wind: the sea
drives him hither and thither.

31. petit governs ⁶ Cretam' as well
as ‘ Syrtes.'
