·ODE ΙΙ.

‘Wmvru has no value save to use well: used as Proculeius used it, it wins
, immortal fame. To tame the spirit of avarice is more than -to own the world.

· ¹ Avarice is like the thirst of dropsy, which grows by indulgence. Virtue calls him

alone happy, him alone the true king, who has subdued the love of money.’

That the Ode is addressed to Salustius is enough to show that there could be
no danger of the world‘s applying its doctrine to him.

The little we know of him is chiefly derived from Tacitus, Ann. 3. 30, where
his death in Aa). 20 is recorded: ‘ Crispum, equestri loco, C. Salustius rerum
Romanarum florentissimus auctor, sororis nepotem, in nomen adscivit. Atque ille
quanquam prompto ad capessendos honores aditu, Maecenatem aemulatus, sine
dignitate senatoria multos triumphalium consulariumque potentia anteiit, diversus a

veterum instituto per cultum et munditias copiaque et affluentia luxu propior. t-

Suberat tamen vigor animi negotiis par, eo acrior quo somnum et inertiam magis
ostentabat. Igitur incolumi Maecenate proximus, mox praecipuus cui secreta
imperatorum inniterentur, et interficiendi Postumi Agrippae conscius, aetate pro-
vecta speciem magis in amicitia principis quam vim tenuit.¹ Horace had satirised

3 ,him some years before (Sat. 1. 2. 48 foll.), but he has now *made his acquaintance in
³ the Court circle. Pliny (N. H. 34. 2) mentions that the Sallust family possessed

copper mines in the Tarentaise· (‘Centronum tractu ’), and it has been suggested
that this gave a special point to the first stanza, ⁶ As you know from your expe-

’ rience of ore.’
