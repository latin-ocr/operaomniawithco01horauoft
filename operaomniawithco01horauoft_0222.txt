180 HORATII CARMINUM

ODE IV.

‘Ouanota aid me in my song. Is it a delusion‚ or am 1 already among the
Muses, hearing and seeing them? 1 am their favourite. In my childhood the wood-
pigeons covered me with leaves when 1 was asleep on the hillside, and through life
the Muses have given me a special protection. For their love 1 esmped Philippi,
and the falling trec, and shipwreck off Palinurus. And they are Caesar’s solaee
and refreshment too. They give him gentle counseIS‚ and he accepts them. We
all know how Jove's bolt swept away the brutal* Titans; for all their strength of
arm, and piled mountains and uprooted trees, they could not stand against Pallas
and the gods who ranged themselves around her. Strength without mind falls of
its own weight; strength, tempered with moderatim, the gods advance and pro-
tect. The giants are in Tartarus, and will never be released. Lawless lust is
punished with endless chains?

This Ode deals with the side os the imperial re'gime which probably did most to
attract and hold fast such adherents as Horace himself. The Muses themselves
‘gave gentle counsels to Caesar: It was the rdgime of moderation, of refinemenc ⁸
of literary culture. Those who still continued to conspire against this gentle rule

were as the giants trying to overthrow the Olympian gods, and restore the dominion ’ ⁷

of insensate force and lawlaes lust. But force without wisdom was powerlaes.
