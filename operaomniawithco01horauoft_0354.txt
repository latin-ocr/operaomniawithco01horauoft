312 HORATII CARMINUM

ODE‘ XV.

‘ Wmmr: victories‚ after all, are what Phoebus forbade me to sing of. The
glory of Caesar’s reign is not war; but peace, plenty, the standards recovered from
Parthia, and the gate of Janus closed—morality and the old character that gave
Rome her empire restored. While Caesar guards us, there is no sear that citizen
will list hand in civil war, or Daciam Mede, or Scythian in foreign war. For us,
every day over the cheerful family board, when the due libations have been made
to the godS‚ we will sing, as our fathers sang before us, of the great oeptains of past'
' time, and of the house of Anchises and Venus.'

We can hardly doubt that the Ode is intended as an epilogue to the Book, the
final answer to Augustus’ request. It has been supposed by many editors to mrry
internal evidence of having been composed as late as ac. 10. The sole argument
is the mention in v. 9 of the closing of the temple of Janus, which was taken to
refer to the third closing in Augustus’ reign, which has been placed in that year.
Franke shows that the evidence even of this date is very doubtful, and in any case
it is admitted that the gate was closed in 29 and 25, and there is no word in the
Ode to fix the reference to a third closing.

2. increpuit lyra, in the common
sense of ‘increpare,’ ‘to reprovess but

with reference to its originalgmeaning,
¹ to make a noise at,’ ‘ thundered at me
on his 1yre.' This mode of taking the
words is rendered certain by Ovid‚ A. A.

manifestus Apollo Movit inauratae pol-
lice fila lyrae‚' etc. All the Scholiasts
took ‘ lyra' with ⁴ loqui‚' and Ritter,
of modern editors, follows them. The
