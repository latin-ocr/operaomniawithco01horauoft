HORATII CARMINUM

Nam quae nivali pascitur Algido
Devota quercus inter et ilices ιο
Aut crescit Albanis in herbis ’
Victima pontificum secures
Cervice tinget: te nihil attinet
Tentare multa caede bidentium
Parvos coronantem ‘marino 15 ·
Rore deos fragilique myrto'.
Immunis aram si tetigit manus,
Non sumptuosa blandior hostia

9. pasoitur, ‘is even now feeding.’

Algido: see on 1. 21. 6, where
⁰ gelido ' is possibly the same as ‘ nivali ’
here. Cp. 4. 4. 57. ”

10. devota, already destined for
sacrifice. Cp. Virg. G. 3. 157, where
the destination of the different calves
is* settled immediately on their birth:
‘Aut aris servare sacros aut scindere
terram!

12. pontificum, i. e. at public sa-
crifices; opposed to simpler home
rites.

13. nihil attinet, οὐδὲν προσήκει,
⁶ there is no need.’ “

14. tenter-aas it were ‘to lay siege
to' their goodwill. Cp. A. P.. 405
‘gratia regum Pieriis tentata modis,'
and Virgil's ⁶ animam tentare precando‚’
Aen. 4. 113. ‘ Deos ’ is constructed ἀπὸ
κοινοῦ (see on 1. 3. 6) after ‘tentare'
and ⁸ coronantem ’; ¹ parvos ' is properly
an epithet of the images, not of the gods
themselves, and therefore belongs to
‘Deos' as the object os ‘coronantem'
rather than as the object of ‘tentare'
(see on 2. 5. 13) ; at the same time it is
antithetieal to ‘ multa caede,' so that it
cannot be severed from ‘tentare,' but
serves rather as a link between the two
clauses, as though he said ‘your very
gods are small (i. e. in their representa-
thve images): adapt your offerings to
t em?

15. parvos, as Tibull. l. c. ‘exigua
ligneus aede deus.‘ Cp. with all this
Juv. 12. 87, 88.

marino rore, rosemary.

16. fragili, ‘ easily plucked,’ a sprig of
‚myrtle, opposed to more elaborate and
expensive garlands: so ‘simplex myrtus’
(1. 38. 5) opposed to ‘nexae 'philyra
coronae.'

¹7·²0· ‘Though thy hand when it

was laid on the altar held no gift, it has
sostened the displeasure of the Penates
with the pious offering of meal and
erackling salt, and could please no more
with [i. e. if it brought] a costly victim,’
‘ Si '=‘ etiam si ’ς ‘ non blandior '=‘non
blandior futura,¹ ‘ non gratior iis futura
per sumptuosam hostiam,' Lambin.
The Scholiasts Aer. and Porph. make

‘immunis’=‘immunis scelerum: the ι

sentiment being then general, not spe-
cial to Phidyle: ‘if the hand that is
laid on the altar be exempt from crime.
it softens,‘ etc„ and the majority of edi-
tors follow them. The common mean-
ing of ‘immunis’ is ‘exempted from
some public duty or tax? 1t was used
metaphorically, but with a genitive case
of that from which exemption was
claimed: Virg. Aen. 12. 559 ‘immunem
belli: and, to come nearer to the present
ease, Ov. Her. 14. 8 ‘immunes caedis
habere manus! But it isv hard to see
how‘immunis’ could have meant ‘peace-
ful· in Virgil or-‘pure from blood’ in
Ovid, if the genitives had been omitted.
On the other hand, Horace uses the adj.
in two other passages (Od. 4. 12. 23
‘non ego te meis Immunem meditor
tingere poeulis,' and Epp. 1. 14. 33 ‘ im·
munem Cinarae placuisse rapaci ⁹) in the
sense of ‘without gifts,' ada tin the
word, after his fashion, to e reek
ἅδωροο. Orelli, giving up the theory of
an ellipsis, tries, not very successfully,
to bring the word round to the Scho-
liasts’ meaning of ‘guiltless,’ by explain-

what it brings freely, not as a due to
expiate any crime. But the whole at-
tempt to soree this meaning on ‘im-
munis‚’ seems to be founded on a mis-
conception of the stanza. The moral
