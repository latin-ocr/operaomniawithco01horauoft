politics. The names are often used merely as poetical expressions of

, distance, the extreme North (as in Od. 2. 20), or generally for the

northern tribes, as the supposed representatives of the manlier virtues
(as in Od. 3. 24) or as the objects of the vague fears of Roman states·

men (Od. 2. 11. 1).
The Daci are mentioned by Dio 51. 22 as offering their services to

7. Octavianus, and when their terms were declined 'by him joining

Antony, to whom, however, they rendered little assistance, as they
were quarrelling amongst themselves (see Od. 3. 6. 13).

In 13.c. 30, M. Crassus, at the bidding of Octavianus, marehed
northward from Macedonia, and won some victories over the Daci
and Bastarnae as well as the Moesi, for which he was allowed a
triumph, Dio 51. 23.

’ From the Epitome of Livy (Β. 135) it appears that Crassus was
again fighting in Thrace in B.c. 25.

Florus (4. 12, § 18) speaks of Lentulus driving the Daci beyond
the Danube, but no date is given. His words may be worth quoting
sor his mention of Cotiso (Od. 3. 8. 18) and for the illustration of

ι Horace's expression ‘intra praescriptum equitare,' Od. 2. 9. 23:

‘ Daci montibus inhaerent 3 Cotisonis ¹ regis imperio quoties concretus

= gelu Danubius iunxerat ripas decurrere solebant et vicina populari.
2 Visum est Caesari Augusto gentem aditu difficillimam submovere.
T· Misso igitur Lentulo ultra ulteriorem repulit ripam: citra praesidia

constituit, sic tunc, Dacia non victa sed submota atque dilata est.

,¹ Sarmatae patentibus campis inequitant 3 et hos per eundem Lentulum

prohibere Danubio satis suit!
It is obvious that there is nothing here to fix the date of the

’,Ἴ debated Ode 3. 8. The victory of Crassus will satisfy the expres-

sions of ν. 18, and so would the victory of Lentulus, but this last is

ἦ itself undated.

The only political event connected with the Eastern Scythians
which is alluded to in these Books, is their interference on behalf

ἶ of Phraates, which will be noticed immediately under the Parthian

affairs.
