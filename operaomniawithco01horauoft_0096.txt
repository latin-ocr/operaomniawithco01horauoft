54 HORATH CARMINUM

Aiacem3 tamen heu serus adulteros
Crines pulvere collines. ²0
Non Laertiaden, exitium tuae
Genti, non Pylium Nestora respicis?
Urgent impavidi te Salaminius
Teucer et Sthenelus sciens
Pugnae, sive opus est imperitare equis, 25
Non auriga piger3 Merionen quoque
Nosces. Ecce furit te reperire atrox
Tydides melior patre,
Quem tu, cervus uti vallis in altera
Visum parte lupum graminis immemor, 30
Sublimi fugies mollis anhelitu,
Non hoc pollicitus tuae.
Iracunda diem proferet Ilio
Matronisque Phrygum classis Achille1'3
Post certas hiemes uret Achaicus 35
Ignis Iliacas domos. ⁷

read‘ Teucer te,’ he does not distinctly
cite the oldest. The considerations in

favour of‘ et' are. (1) that there was

an obvious metrical reason for altering
