HORATII CARMEN SECULARE.

Alterum in lustrum meliusque semper

Prorogat aevum.

Quaeque Aventinum tenet Algidumque,
uQuindeciJn Diana preces virorum 70
Curat et votis puerorum amicas

Applicat aures.

Haec Iovem sentire deosque cunctos
Spem bonam certamque domum reporto,
Doctus et Phoebi chorus et Dianae 75

Dicere laudes.

conjunction of the words in Ennius'
verses, ‘Audire est operae pretium,
procedere recte Qui rem Romanam
Latiumque augescere voltis’; but even
there ‘ Latiumque ' is in its own clause,
and not a bald addition to ⁴ rem Roma-
nam!

period is named here clearly as the time
for which nominally Augustus has re-
accepted the ’ Imperium '; see Introd.

meliusque, ¹ and for ages that grow
ever better.’

68. prorogat. This, and the 'corre-
s ponding‘ curat‚’ ‘applicatss are the read-
ings of B and V, against the more com-
mon ‘lproroget ‘lcuret app plicet.' It
would almost seem that the Scholiasts
read the subjunctive ln the first oese, but
the indicative in the other two3 for
they explain that ⁴ si.' from v. 65, must
be repeated before ‘curat ’ and ‘applicat’
(making them parallel with ‘videt ')‚
and the apodosis ‘ remque . . aevum'
understood again. ⁵ Proroget' they
interpret by ⁶ prorogabit,' Aer. and ‘ me-
lius seculum futurum tribuet’ (with a
v. 1. ‘tribuat’), Porph. Their explana-
tion clearly cannot stand3 and, though
Keller edits in accordance with their
presumed reading, it is hard to see how
the change of mood can be justified.
The indicatives are accep ted, among
recent editors, by Dillr„ Ritter and
Munro Bentley argues strongly for
them, pointing out that the time for

urgent prayer and expostulation is past.
The chorus has now assumed the tone
of confidence and promise (according to
the stages named in Epp. 2. 1. 134
‘Poscit opem chorus, et praesentia

numina sentit‘). The last stanza, ‘ Haec ⁷

Iovem sentire,’ etc„ comes naturally to
sum up and erown their assertions of
Apollo's and Diana’s goodwilh it
would be abmpt if the prayer continued· ‘
to v. 72.

69. Aventinum. The chief temple
on the Aventine was that of Dian25 see
Bura, p 204, cp. Liv. 1. 45.

Algiduxm see Od. 1. 21. 6.

70. quindecim virorum. The· xv
virisacris faciendisss or ‘.sacrorum ’were
the‘ collegium' who hadthe custody of
the Siby lline books, and the dutyy of
superintending any religious ceremonies
prescribed' ιιι them. Τίιε college at first
consisted only of two. It was raised to
ten about the year 13.c. 367 (⁶ decem-
viri? Liv. 6. 37, 42), and su ently
to fifteen, probably by Sulla. Aeneas
is made to promise the Cumaean Sibyl
the institution of the priesthood in
Virg. Aen. 6. 72 ‘Hic ego namque tuas
sortes arcanaque fata, Dicta meae
genti, ponam, lectosque sacmbo.A1ma
