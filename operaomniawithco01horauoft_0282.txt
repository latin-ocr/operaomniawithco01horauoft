240 HORATII CARMINUM

ODE xxva

ΙΝ this Ode, as in 2. 19, Horace has tried to catch the inspiration of a Greek
dithyramb. In that one he professes to recall the effects which the sight of
Bacchus had upon him: in the present one he is actually under the influence of
the afflatus. ‘ He is hurried away, whither he *knows not: his eyes are opened on
strange caverns and river-banks and woods. His tongue will be loosed in a
moment to sing no humble theme, and in no common stmin, the glories of Caesarz
he follows the god, for he must, and it is delightful, but it is fearful too.'

The glory of Caesar is only mentioned as the subject of athe coming burst of

song; but the place os honour given to it is in effect the celebration which is
promised. See 1. 6, Introd.

QUO me,'Bacche, rapis tui
Plenum? quae nemora aut quos agor ‘in specus
Velox mente nova? quibus
Antris egregii Caesaris audiar
Aeternum meditans decus 5
stellis inserere et consilio Iovis? '

1. tui plenum; 2. 19. 6 ⁶ pleno
Bacchi pectore!

2. For the omission of the preposition
with the first substantive cp. Epp. 2. r.
25 ⁶ Vel Gabiis vel cum rigidis aequata

meditans == μελετῶν, · plmning.'
⁴ practising! Possibly also it suggested
the idea, which it often conveyS. of
poetical composition as the means os
conferring the promised glory: ⁴medi-

Sabinis‚' Virg. Aen. 6. 692 ⁸ Quas ego
te terras et quanta per aequoro vectum
Aspicio.' It was a Greek licence; cp.
amongst others Soph.O.T. 734 σχιστὴ δ’
ὁδὸς 'Es ’ταύτὸ Δελφῶν κάπὸ Δαυλίας ἄγει.

3. velox mente nova. The inspira-
tion so alters him that he can hardly re-
cognize his soul as his own. audit endows
him with the swiftness of thought.

quibus antris, local ablative.

4-6. The constr. is ⁶ audiar, meditans
inserere.’ Horace already ‘ meditatur
inserere,' etc. 'Hie question is where
his, dreamings will find voice and an
auditor-y.

4. egregii, 1. 6. 11.

5. aeternum is pred„ ‘to set Caesaes

glory as a new star in the skies for
ever.

tari' is used in the sense of ⁴ composing
aloud’ in Virg. E. 6. 82 ⁸ Omnia quae
Phoebo quondam meditante beatus
Audiit Eurotas.’

6. consilio Iovis, ⁸ the council board
of Jupiter? Virgil’s ‘ quem mox quae
sint habitura deorum Concilia‚’ G. 1. ²4·
is hardly as high a compliment to
Augustus’ wisdom. Bentley would fol-
low a minority of MSS. in reading*⁸ con-
cilio ' here also; but Orelli points out
that as ‘ concilium' means only a q

   

‘ athering,' ‘ concilium deorum‘ is α·
na u ression, ‘concilium Iovis’
scarcely so. The general terms in
which Caesar’s apotheosis is spoken of
are the same in the two es. In
both he is at one moment to be a god.
at another a star.
