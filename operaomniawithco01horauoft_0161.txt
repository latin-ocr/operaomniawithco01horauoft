Quo pinus ingens albaque populus
Umbram hospitalem consociare amant ιο
Ramis? Quid obliquo laborat
Lympha fugax trepidare rivo?
Huc vina et unguenta et nimium breves
F lores amoenae ferre iube rosae,
Dum res et aetas et sororum ' 15
Fila trium patiuntur atra.
Cedes coemptis saltibus et domo

9-11. quo..qu1d, ‘to what pur-
pose? why?’ ‘to what purpose but
that you may make merry in the
shade?' Dillr. quotes, for the chan ge
os conjunctim, Ov. Met. 13. 516⁸ Quo
ferrea resto? Quidve moror’ ’ἰ Τ1115 15
the reading of the oldest MSS. includ-
ingVand B. Alarge number have‘ quo

.,’quo in which case the two clauses
inust be written without a note of ques-
tion, as ‘quo’ will answer to ‘‚huc⁰
‘ hither to the spot to which the boughs
streteh out and to which the stream is
in such haste to hurry down.’ The
lemma in the MSS. of Porph. has in the

“ second place ‘ quo,’ but whatever he read,

he interpreted- it ‘ wherefore’? for he
writes ‘ subaudiendum, si ea non utimur.'
It must be allowed that this possibility
of a double interpretation is in favour
of ⁸ quo! Keller edits ‘ quo et,’ which
Bentley found in some MSS. The hiatus,
if we retain‘ quo, ’ must be classed with
Epod.5. 100.

9. alba, as ‘candida populus’ Virg.
E. 9. 41. The double contrast between
¹ the slighter poplar white in the wind
. and the gloom of the heavier pine is
indicated, after Horace' 5 manner, by one

⁴ epithet with each of the pair of sub-

stantives, see on 3. 4 46, 47, 3.13. 7,
4.4. 10. For8 his notice of colour cp.

amant, rather on aceopnt of the
place or for the pleasure

of shading the revellers, than (as Orelli

ξ. takes-it) as though the boughs them-
j selves were lovers, after the image of

‘lascivae hederae) 1. 36. 2ο. ‘Amare'
is used by Horace and other Graecising
Latin writers in imitation of φιλεῖν, but
it rarely, if ever, attains the colourless

or unconsciously idiomatic force of :-

the original.

11.1aborat trepidare, App. 2, ξι,
‘frets in its haste to escape down its
tortuous charmel? Contrast the water
which (Epp. 1. ιο. 21)· per pronum
trepidat cum murmure riv um.

13. breves, accusative, Od. 1. 36 16
‘breve lilium? Here the epithet is in
point, for the roses are types of the
pleasures of life that must be snatched
quickly‚ so that it has the force of ‘ ere
they be withered.'

15. res, ‘ patrimonium? Schol. Prob-
ably so, rather than with Orelli, ‘tota

vitae conditio. ’ There is no sear, Orelli ⁴

says, that Dellius' fortune should prove
inadequate. But he may lose it, and, at
any rate, it is only his for a short time,

lavit. yHorace prefers this, the older
form, in theOdes; cp. 3. 4. 61, 3. 12. 2,

uses also the first conj„ as Sat. 1. 3. 137,
