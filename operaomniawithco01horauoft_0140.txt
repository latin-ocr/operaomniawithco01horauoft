98 HORATII CARMINUM

Cogor relictos: namque Diespiter, 5
Igni corusco nubila dividens
Plerumque, per purum tonantes ·
Egit equos volucremque currum,
Quo bruta tellus et vaga flumina,
Quo Styx et invisi horrida Taenari 10

Sedes Atlanteusque finis
Concutitur. Valet imfa summis

5. Diespiter, a religious archaism,
affected by Horace again in Od. 3. a. 29 ι
cp. Varr. L. L. 5. 66 ‘antiquius Iovis
nomen: nam olim Diovis et Diespiter
dictus, id est dies pater.’ So A. Gell. 6. 12
‘ Iovis Diespater appellatus est, id est, diei
et lucis pater,' and Macr. Satum. 2. 15.
It is connected by them with the nam'e
¹ Lucetius‚’ given to himin the hymns of
the Salii. It occurs probably in the
formula of the Fetialoe‚ Liv. 1. 24 (see
Prof. Seeley’s note). On the etymology
see Corssen, Aussprach. 1. 233: he re-
fuses to allow the composition of a'
Latin word by means of a genitive ωδε,
and therefore sees in Dies- a form of
the stem which also appears in the
Greek εὐ-διέσ-τεροε, and ‘ with the Latin
change of s to r' in ‘ ho-dier·nus.'

7. plerumque. All the older com·
mentators who notice the point join
⁴ plerumque‘ with ‘ egit‚’ not perceiving
that Horace is speaking of a single in·
stance in his own experience. For the
emphatic position of ⁸ plerumque’ at
the end of its clause Bentl. compares
Epp. 2. 2. 84 and Lucr. 5. 1131.

purum, the cloudless sky; ‘sole
puro‚’ Od. 3. 29. 45, cp. 3. 10. 8. Thun-
der, under such circumstances, is a
special portent in the poets3 Hom⁴ Od.
20. 112-114, Virg. G. 1. 487‚Aen. 8. 524
soll„ Ov. Fast. 3. 370, etc.

8. currum, Od. 1. 12. 58.

‘earth‚ though you might think it too
dull and still, the streams which seem
as if they moved too quick‚ the abysses
below, the utmost bounds above.⁸

ιο. Taenari: a caver'n in the cliffs of

‘1:aemeer (Cape Matapan) was
thought to bean entrance to HadesNirg.
G. 4. 467 ‘Taenarias fauces, alta ostia
Ditis.’ Ἀιδα στόμα, Pind. Pyth. 4. 44.

11. Atlantem finis. Orelli quotes
τέρμονες Ἀτλαντικοί, Eur. Hipp. 3.

14. apicem seems to be used here,
and in Od. 3. 21. 30 ¹ regum apices? for·
th¹e tiara of eastern kings. It was the
name of the conioel oep worn at Rome
by the ‘flamines’3 see Virg. Aen. 8. 664,
and Conington's note on id. 2. 68 3. Cicero
(Leg'. 1. 1) u'ses it where Livy (1. 34)
uses ‘ pileus,’ in telling the story of the

if Horace is actually thinking of the
vicissitudes of Phraates, he may be also
⁸ borrowing a metaphor to· describe
them from a familiar Roman myth.'

15. Fortuna, not apparently that he
attributes any moral pu ose to For·
tune, as in the following de, or co-or·
dinates her with ‘deus ' as an expression
of the power that governs human life.
It is only (as in Od. 3. ²9· 49 soll.
where also we have her ‘rusliing wings’)

the personification of the vicissitudae of f

life, the effect'that we see, not the muse
which he has traced in the lines befooe.

16. sustfflit. The soimlled ·aoristic’
perfect, ‘ has often, ere now, listed:
Epp. 1. 2. 47, 1. ¹9· 48, Virg. G. 2. 211.
The reference to definite times is
more evident when the tense is qualified
by the addition of ⁸ multi: ‘ nemo,’
