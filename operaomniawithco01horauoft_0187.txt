OD. 13. 145

Quid mirum, ubi illis carminibus stupens
Demittit atras belua centiceps
Aures et intorti capillis 35
Eumenidum recreantur angues?
Quin et Prometheus et Pelopis parens.
Dulci laborem decipitur son03
Nec curat Orion leones
Aut timidos agitare* lyncas. 40

bibit aure: ‘ avide audit,’ Acr. The
sounds are poured, not as into a cup
which receives passive1y‚ but as into the
drinker's mouth.
⁴ 33. illis carminibus, ablative with
'‘stupensss as Sat. 1. 4. 28, 2. 2. 5.
Sappho's singing is included as well as
Alcaeus’. Comparewith these stanzas
Od. 3. 11. 13-24‚ Virg. G. 4. 481-484.

34. demittit aures, contrast Epod.
6. 7 ‘aure sublata: of a hound on the

. scent.

centiceps, possibly to be explained
by 3. 11. 16 ‘ Cerberus, quamvis furiale
centum Muniant angues caput eius,’
since the expression ‘ore trilingui’ (cp.
2. 19. 31) in the same place seems to
imply that there the picture is of three
heads. Sophocles calls Cerberus Αἴδου
τρίκρανον agniacum, Trach. 1098, Hesiod
Ἀίδεω leima χαλκεόφωνον πεντηκοντακά-
ρηνον, Theog. 312; Pindar, acc. to In-
terpr. Ven. on Hom. 11. 8. 368 ἑκατοντα-
3301< ζοῖζξῗέαῗῗῗὲῗῑίἓῗῖῗὲἑῗξῖἕέῗῑὲξῗ
but in a Roman. poet they are echoes,
and there is nothing therefore to pre-
vent Horace giving Cerberus his Sopho-
clean form in one Ode and his Pindaric
complement of heads in another, as
virgil speaks at one time with the
Greektragedians of 'agminaEumenidum‚’
at another> with the Alexandrines of
Megaera, Allecto, and Tisiphone. For
a still more pertinent instance see

compared' with 10. 565, and 6. 605
compared 'with 12. 845.

μέναι rumora δράκουσιν, Virg. G. 4.
48 2'‘ implexae crinibus angues Eumeni-
des! .

36. recreantur, ⁴ take rest?

37. Prometheus. This form of the ’-

legend, which makes Prometheus still
undergo punishment in Tartarus (cp.
Od. 2. 18. 35, Epod. 17. 67), is known
to no other extant author.

Pelopis parens. Tantalus, joined
with Prometheus in the two passages ,
referred to. For the legend of him‘see
Hom. Od. 11. 582.

38. laborem, so Keller edits, fol
lowing the Paris and Beme MSS, fo
the Vulg. ‘laborum.' In either case i
is an attempt to put the usual ‘ deciper
laborem’ (Sat. 2. 2. 12 ‘studio fallent
laborem‘) into the passive, either r
taining its accusative. as in such phrases
as ‘ suspensi tabula-m loculosque lacerto:-
or taking instead of it the Greek geni-
tive of relation. ,

39. Orion. Τὸν δὲ μετ-’,Ὠρίωνα πελώ-
ριον εἰσενόησα Θῆρας ὁμοῦ εἰλεῦντα κατ’
ἀσφοδελὸν λειμῶνα, Hom. Od. 11² 571.
Orion, like Sappho and Alcaeus, IS en-
gaged in the same pursuits as in life.
Virg. Aen. 6. 654 ‘suit ‘vivis quae cura
. . eadem sequitur tellure repost 3ss

40. Priscian, p. 689, quotes this line.
remarking Horace’s use of ‘lyncas' as
masc. ς Virg. G. 3. 264 makes it fem.
‘lynces Bacchi variae.’ Ο
