58 HORATII CARMINUM

Tentavit in dulci iuventa ⁴
Fervor et in celeres iambos
Misit furentem3 nunc ego mitibus 25

Mutare quaero tristia, dum mihi
F ias recantatis amica

you are not as bad as Ι was in your
revengefulness.

23. tentavit, of a disease; Epp. 1. 6.
28 ‘ Si latus aut renes morbo tentan-
tur'; Virg. G. 3. 441 ‘ Turpis oves ten-
tat scabies?

dulci iuventa, ⁶ so sweet,' says Dillr„
⁴ that one can think of nothing else, its
pleasures make one mrelaes ’.ς cp. Od. ¹:
ῗιῖὶὲιιῖςι it ἰξυέῗιιιγ ἷῖῗῗὲζὼέἓῗέωι ἓξὲξ
a man, as he grows old, looks back on
his youth, and pleads for it even while

Opprobriis animumque reddas.

he recounts its ενι-οῖς..

24. celeres, ‘ hasty,’ ‘ impetuous ’ς
cp. Epp. 1. 18. 89 ‘ oderunt . . sedatum
celeres ; but there is some force in
giving the epithet to the ² iambi ' rather
than to himself. He would suggest that
his Pegasus ran away with him.

26. tristia, perhaps with reference to
v. 9. Here, as contrasted with ‘miti-

bus‚’ it carries more distinctly a me- ,

taphor of taste, as Virg. G. 2. 126
‘tristes succi'; G. 1. 75 ‘ triste lupi-

num?

ODE XVII.

ΑΝ invitation to Tyndaris to visit the poet at his Sabine farm, ‘ a very haunt of
Faunus, a heaven-blest spot, where she will find all country pleasurae, and be able
to sing her favourite songs and sip Lesbian in the shade without the brawls of a
city merrymaking or the tipsy violence of Cyrus’ love and joealousy!

VELOX amoenum saepe Lucretilem
Mutat Lycaeo Faunus et igneam

1. Lucretilem. This name probably
covers the whole mass of mountain be-
tween the Licenza valley and the Cam-
pagna-the highest point of which is
now called Monte Gennaro. See Bum’s
v Rome and the Campagna, p. 431.

2. mutat. It is more usual to put
the thing taken in exchange in the abl.,
as in the last Ode, v. 26 ‘ mutare tristia
mitibus'; but Horace often inverts
them as here and in Od. 3. 1. 47 ‘ Cur
valle permutem Sabina Divitias opero-
siores'; cp. Od. 2. 12. 21, Epod. 9. 27,

Sat. 2. 7. 109. The abl. in either case '

is analogous to the abl. of price, the

transaction being regarded from the '

side, in the first case, of the seller‚in-the
second of the buyer.

Lycaeo Faunus. Horace identifies
(see on Od. 2. 17. 28) the Latin Faunus,
the legendary son of Picus, and ἕνα· of '
oracles (Virg. Aen. 7. 48, 81), e god
of agriculture and cattle (Hor. Od. 3.
18), with the Arcadian Pan, ὄρειβάτηε,
the inventor of the pipe (see v. 10). Cp. -“
Ovid, Fast. 2. 267 foll„ and esp. v. 4²4 .
⁶ Faunus in Arcadia templa Lycaeus ha-
bet: ⁸ Lycaeus ’ is a mountain in Arcadia.
