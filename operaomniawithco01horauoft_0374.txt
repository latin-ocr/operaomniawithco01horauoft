HORATII E-PODON

Labuntur altis interim rivis aquae, 25
Queruntur in silvis aveS,
Fontesque lymphis obstrepunt manantibus,
Somnos quod invitet leves. i
At cum tonantis annus hibernus Iovis
Imbres nivesque comparat, 30
Aut trudit acres hinc et hinc multa cane
Apros in obstantes plagas,
Aut amite levi rara tendit retia,
Turdis edacibus dolos, ⁷
Pavidumque leporem et advenam laqueo gruem 35 Β
Iucunda captat praemia. ⁰
Quis non malarum, quas amor curas habet,
Haec inter obliviscitur?

2 5, rivis, the reading of V and B;
though corrected in the latter byasecond
hand to ⁴ ripis‚' the reading of the majority
of MSS. Compare against Orelli's objec—
tions to ‘ rivis,' Od. 2. 3. 1 ι. ‘ Altis rivis’
must apparently mean ‘in brimming
watercourses’: ‘altis ripis’ has been
variously rendered; Bentley, who pre-
fers it on the ground that we are speak-
ing of summer or autumn when streams
are low, interprets ‘with their banks
high? i. e. ‘deep between their banks:
Orelli thinks it is not meant as a pecu-
liarity of the time of year, but as a
general characteristic of the streams
which adds to their beauty and plea-
santness, ‘ between high banks‚‘ i. e. of
foliage, rocks, etc. But a compan'son
of Lucr. 2. 362 (in the same connection
as this) ‘summis labentia ripis‚' and
Quint. 12. 2 ‘ Ut vis amnium maior est
altis ripis multoque gurgitis tractu flu-
entium quam tenuis aquae et obiectu
lapillorum resultantis’ would suggest
that if Horace wrote ‘altis ripis ⁹ he
meant rather ‘high up its banks‚’ so
that it comes to the same as ‘ rivis,’

27. obstrepunt, sc. ⁶ audientibus: see
ο Od. 3. 30. 10. Markland founded on
Prop. 4. 4. 4 ‘Multaque nativis obstrepit
orbor aquis‚’ an ingenious conj. ‘ frondes'
{cg-’“fontes” ‘lymphis’ being then the

twe.

28. quod, sc. ‘ murmur quod.'

29t-36. We pass to winter amuse-
men s.

29. tonantis, an epithet of the

god which has become almost a part
of his name; but it serves to reoell

his influence on the wathes aud re-

sp0nsibility for storms, although thun-
der is rather an accessory of summer
storms.

annus hibernus, the wintry part of
the year, as ‘ frigidus aunus‚' Virg. Aen.-
6. 311. ‘ Jove’s winter’ is the winter
which in its season Jove brings round
again, C. S. 3² ‘Iovis aurae?

32. obstantes, ⁸ set to stop them?

33. levi, prob. ‘smooth.’ though as
‘ames’ does not occur elsewhere in

poetry. it is not possible to prdnounoe t

certainly on the quantity of its first
llable.

Syru-a, ⁸ open? ‘ wide-meshed‚’ see Con.
on Virg. Aen. 4. 131. The e ithets,
though. as has been remark ‚ more
abundant than Horaee’s maturet taste
would have admitted, serve, By remlling
the circumstances, io recall the pleasures
os the sport.

35, laqueo, a dissyllable not an
anapaest, cp. Epod. 5. 79, 11. 23, and
see Index of Metrae.

37 fou. The ‘malae amoris σαι-ηεξ its
solli& and fancies and jealousies are lest
for the idle andvluxurious life of the
city. The ‘ pudica uxor’ and the plea-
surffl of home are more likely to be
found in the country. Virg. G. 2. 523
‘ dulces pendent circum oscula nati;
Casta pudicitiam servat domus! For
the atti-action which makes ‘curas'
agree with the relative, and leaves
