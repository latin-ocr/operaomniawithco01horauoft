Tu, curn timenda voce complesti nemus,
Proiectum odoraris cibum. 10
Cave, cave: namque in malos asperrimus

Parata tollo cornua,

Qualis Lycambae spretus ainfido gener
Aut acer hostis Bupalo.

An, si quis atro dente me petiverit, 15
Inultus ut flebo puer?

praecedet. Dillr. prefers the read-
ing of a few MSS. ‘procedet’ (in the
sense ⁴of ‘obviam veniat‚’just as ‘ proiec-
tum' in v. 10 seems=‘obiectum’)‚ in
order to soften still more the change of
metaphor by making the hunting merely
a part of guarding the sold, and chasing
away of a wolf that comes near. But
Horace is intent on the different points
of contrast between the good and the
bad writer of ‘iambi‚' and the metaphors
, change rapidly.

p 14. hostis Bupalo. Hipponax, an
iambic poet who used his art to revenge
himself on Bupalus and Athenis, two
sculptors of Chios, and brothers, who
had caricatured his ugliness. Notice
that each of the epithets ‘ infido,’ ‘acen’
is intended, after Horace’s manner, to
cover to some extent 'both mses. They
strike again the keynote of the Epode.
The masters of iambic verse whom Ho-
race imitates were like him, unlike his
opponent: they struck only at those

-who deserved it, and they struck home.
