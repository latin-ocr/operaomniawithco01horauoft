comm Introduction to 1. 26. The purpose of this Ode can only be guessed.
The introductory passage seems very much as if it was playsul. It tr'aces Aelius
Lamia’s pedigree to Lamus, the Homeric king of the Laestrygones (Od. 10. 81 Ἑβ-
δομάτῃ δ’ ἱκόμεσθα Λάμου αἰπὺ πτολίεθρον Τηλέπυλον Λαιστρυγονίην. Cp. Cic. ad Att.

lost work, De F amiliis Troianis. The Lamiae, though not famous in the ages of
the Repubhc, seem to have been a prominent family under the Empire. Juv. Sat.

Horace writes the day before a holiday, possibly to Lamia at some country
house which belonged to him near Formiae. This would give an additional point
to the mention of the sea-shore and to the genealogical introduction, as if the poet
