EPODE XIV.

‘You are always asking me why Ι am so forgetful of my promise to finish my
Epodes. It is love that hinders me. 1 am not the first poet who has been the

slave of love. You know the pain yourself. But you are a happy man compared
with me?

Metre-Pythiambicum 1¹¹¹.

MOLLIS inertia cur tantam diffuderit imis
Oblivionem sensibus,

Pocula Lethaeos ut si ducentia somnos
Arente fauce traxerim,

Candide Maecenas, occidis saepe rogando: 5
Deus, deus nam me vetat

Inceptos, olim promissum carmen, iambos
Ad umbilicum adducere.

Non aliter Samio dicunt arsisse Bathyllo
Anacreonta Teium, 10

Qui persaepe cava testudine flevit amorem
Non elaboratum ad pedem.

Ureris ipse miser: quodsi non pulchriorigniS
Accendit obsessam Ilion, ’

4. arente fauce, and therefore greed-
ily, a large draught.
5. candide, Epp. 1.

‘ iambi,' Epodes3 and ‘Bionei sermoneS.'

corresponds to ⁶ saepe rogando.¹

6. deuS, sc. ‘ Amor.'

nam, gives the reason of ‘ occidis!
‘ It is wearisome to be asked, for Ι have
only one answer to give.¹

7. olim, better probably with ‘pro-
missum ’ than with ‘ inceptos!

promissum, ⁶ promised to the world,’
as A. P. 45 ‘ promissi carminis auctor.'

iambos, under this name Horace
would include all his Epodes‚ as in Epp.

Ostendi Latio? In Epp. 2. 2. 59 he
divides his poetry into ‘ carmina: ⁶ Odes’;

tened to the bottom of the parchment
when full, and on which it was rolled.
The expression, therefore, means to pre-
pare for publication and to finish.
Mart. 21. 91. 1 ‘Ohe iam satis est ohe
libelle, Iam pervenimus usque ad um-

9-12. This may possibly mean that
Anacreon also had given his love as an
excuse for not writing.

‘numeris lege solutis‚’ Od. 4. 2. 11.

P 13. ignis. With the play on the
double meaning of ‘ignis‘ cp. Od. 2. 4. 7
