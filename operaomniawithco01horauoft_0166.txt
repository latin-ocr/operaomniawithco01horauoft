124 H ORATII CARMINUM

Iam te sequetur: currit enim ferox
Aetas et illi, quos tibi dempserit,
Apponet annos3 iam proterva 15
Fronte petet Lalage maritum:
Dilecta, quantum non Pholoe fugaX,
Non Chloris albo sic humero nitens,
Ut pura nocturno renidet
Luna mari, Cnidiusve Gyges, 20
Quem si puellarum insereres choro,
Mire sagaces falleret hospites
Discrimen obscurum solutis
Crinibus ambiguoque voltu.

13. ferox aetas. ‘Her time of life
makes her shy, and time is flying.’
To the rest of the sentence, ‘aetasl in
its general sense, alone is the subj. ; the
epithet has no further relation to it.
Cp. Od. 1. 21. 7, 8 ‘nigris aut Ery-
manthi silvis aut viridis Cragi,' and
3. ²3- 15, where ‘ parvos' is the epithet

Epp. 1. 1. 20 foll. Such expressions as
A. P. 175 ‘ anni venientes, recedentes’
(cp. Od. 2. 11. 5), Soph. Trach. 547
ὁρῶ μὲν ἥβην τὴν μὲν ἔρπουσαν πρόσω
Τὴν δὲ φθίνουσαν are not in point.
They refer not to different ways of
viewing the same time, but to different '
epochs of life. Tbey suppose an ἀκμή,

of ⁸ Deos‚’ so long as they are the obj.
of ‘ coronantem,’ not when they are the
obj. of ⁴ tentare.¹ Dillr„ however, follows
Mitseh. in taking ‘ ferox ' of the flight of
time, ‘like an unbroken horse‚’ as Ov.
Fast. 6. 772 ‘fugiunt freno non remo-
rante dies.¹

14· dempserit, apponet, a ground
for not being impatient. ‘ If you are
losing the years fast, she is gaining
them as fast.’ Each fresh year of life
is a year added or a year taken away,
according to our point of view. Com-
pare the double phrase by which
Horace expresses the lapse of time in
Od. 3. 30. 5 ‘ annorum series et suga
temporum.’ So Seneca de Cons. ad Marc.
20 ‘ Quo quisque primum lucem vidit
iter mortis ingressus est, accessitque fato
propior; et illi ipsi qui adiiciebantur
adolescentiae anni vita detrahebantur.'
Cp. Soph. Aj. 476 παρ’ἧμαρ ἡμέρα .. Προσ·
θεισα κάναθεΐσα τοῦ ’γε κατθανεῖν. To
the impatient lover time seems to be
robbing him of year after year, and to
be making no difference to Lalage, to
be ‘ galloping' with him while it
‘crawls’ or stands still with her, cp.

a definite point to which life ascends
and from which it descends. Horace
does not mean here to represent his
lover as going down the hill of
life.
15. proterva tronto, a return to the
metaphor of stanzas 1, 2. mag
ι e·

17. dilecta, sc. ‘a te.'
whom you love with a passion you
never felt for any other.' -His pre-
eminent love forssLalage is the measure
both of the happiness for which he is

bidden to wait and of the impatience ’

with which he waits for it.

Pholoe fugax, see on od. 1. 3. 36
‘ asperam Pholoen! Her flight is one
which attracts pursuit, ‘ fugit ad salices
et se cupit ante videri?

non, non, ve, cp. Od. 2. 9. 1-6 ‘ non:
‘aut,' ‘ nec,' ‘ aut.'

19. pura, Od. 3. 29. 45 ‘sole puro:
free from mist or cloud.

renidet, in what is its first sense,
‘ shines again’; Od. 2. 18. 2 ‘ aureum . .
renidet lacunar ’ς Epod. 2. 66 ¹ reni·
dentes lares.'

22. mire, with ‘ falleret.’

hospites, strangers who came in.
