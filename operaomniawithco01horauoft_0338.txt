296 HORATII CARMINUM ”

Vivuntque commissi calores
Aeoliae fidibus puellae.
Non sola comptos arsit adulteri.
Crines et aurum* vestibus illitum ’
Mirata regalesque cultusv Α ¹5
Et comites Helene Lacaena,
Primusve Teucer tela Cydonio
Direxit arcu3 non semel Ilios
Vexata; non pugnavit ingens
Idomeneus Sthenelusve solus ⁷ 20
Dicenda Musis proelia3 non ferox -
Hector vel acer Deiphobus graves
Excepit ictus pro pudicis
Coniugibus puerisque primus,
Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona 25·
Multi; sed omnes illacrimabiles*
Urgentur ignotique longa
Nocte, carent quia vate sacro.

11. commissi, confided as secrets.
Sat. 2. 1. 30 ‘Ille velut fidis arcana
sodalibus olim credebat libris! ‘She
to!d her secret to the lute, And yet its
chords with passion thrill‚‘ Conington.

12. Aeoliae3 2. 13. 24.

13 foll. Horace passes from the
defence of lyric poetry as contrasted
with epic, to the power of verse gener-
ally. He employs a variety of forms

to express the central thought, viz. that ·

the persons and deeds which are Homer’s
theme, had their counterparts in the age
before him, as worthy of record as they,
yet which all perished as though they
had never been. ⁶ Non sola‚' ‘primusve‚'
¹ non semel,’ ‘non solus,’ ⁶ non primus.’
Then the same thought is stated affirm-
atively in v. 2 5.

13-16. The construction is ‘non sola
arsit crines, mirata et aurum cultusque
et comites,' ‘ que' eoupling the things
more closely connected, ‘ et . . et ‘ those
which are more distinct, ‘ his dress and
his suite.‘

14. crinem 1. 15. 14.

16. Lacaena. The epithet recalls
the whole story of the Trojan war. It
would not have been in place a stanza
later 3 but here the complete identifica-

tion‚ as though he had said ⁴ Homer’s
Helen,' helps the transition.

17. Temen 1. 15. 24, Hom. 11. 13.
313 δε ἄριστος Ἀχαιῶν τοξοσύνῃ.

Spicula! Cydon or Cydonia ‘was an
important city of Crete3 Herod. 3. 44,
Thuc. 2. 35. Δ ἔ , ,

18. non semel Ilios, not referring,
as Ritter and others have taken it, to
any legend of two sieges of Troy. but
meaning ⁶ the siege os Troy- was not
unprecedented.' ‘A Troy‚' a city as>
great as Troy, has osten stood as long a
sie e.

ξι. He passes from the gallantry of
attack to that of defence3 from Grecian
heroes to Trojan.

26. illacrimabiles‚ ¹ where none can
weep for them.' The adjective is used
actively in 2. 14·- 6.

lying heavy on them3 1. ²4· 5.

28. sacro, he is ,the favour-ite of
Apollo, of Bacchus. of Mei-cury, the
‘Musarum sacerdos,' who can confer 'un-
mortality by his poetry; ‘sacrare plec-
tr0‚’ 1. mas‘Caelo Musa beat‚'4.8.29.
