24. per ignes. Bentley, as usual, is
far better than his critics. His way out
of the difficulty, by substituting conjec-
turally ‘ enseS‚' is not one in which we
can follow him. But he disposes, in
advance‚ of all the parallels which are
still quoted on the view that the ex—
pression is metaphorical= ‘ per medium
ardorem ugnae,’ Com. Cruq. One
class, suc as Virgil's ‘medias acies

’ mediosque per ignes‚’ Aen. 7. 296, indi-

cate the direct opposite, sor they refer
to the literal fires of Troy 3 and Silius’
imitations (14. 1:75 and 15. 41) are just
the same—the fires are as literal as the
swords. The other claSS, such as Ho-
race’s own ‘ per mare . . per saxa, per
ignes‚‘ Epp. 1. 1. 43, ‘ignes Per medios
fluviosque ruentis,' Sat. 2. 3. 56, estab-
lish the proverbial use of ⁴ fire,' asone
among many metaphors of extreme
dangers or obstacles; but do not parallel
the substitution of ‘to ride his horse
through the middle of the fire‚’ for
‘through the hottest sight? We have
gone too far in the sentence with un-
metaphorical language, to tolerate being
pulled up suddenly by a bold metaphor.
The fires may well be the buming vil-
lages of the Raeti through which T ibe-
rius forced his way.

25. sio volvitur. The simile is

izes the river of his own birth—place ; see

G. 4. 371 ‘Et gemina auratus taurino

rum! It is a disputed question whether
the original idea was of the horn-like
branchings of a river, or of its violence,
or of its roaring; μεμυκὼς ἠΰτε ταῦρος,
Hom. Il. 21. 237, of the Xanthus. Cp.
¹ longe sonans,' of the Aufidus, 4. 9. 2.
But whatever was —its origin, Horace
probably feels the image suggested by
the epithet through the following lines;
so that there is almost a simile within
the simile. Tiberius is like the Aufidus
in flood: the Aufidus is like a bull
charging down the mountain side.

28. meditatur. The good MSS. are
divided between this word and ‘mini-
tatur.' Porph. read ‘ meditatur: though
some little doubt is thrown on his testi-
mony also by variance of MSS, and
Servius quotes it to illustrate Georg. 3.

Porph.’s criticism ‘ maledixit ‘¹ medi-
tatur ” quia in ipso actu est nec debet
cogitare aut condiscere quod iam facit‚’
seems to be that the image is not: of the
river actually flooding the lowlands‚ but
of the boiling waters of its upper course
filling its channel to the brim, and
threatening a flood to the lower levels.

30. diruit. This verb, more com÷
monly used of laying buildings in ruin,
is justified here, on the one side, by the
image of the river, ὅε τ’ ὦκα ῥέων ἐκέ-
δασσε Ὑεφῦραε (Hom. l. c.) ; on the
other, by the epithet of ‘ agmina’; the
⁶ steelclad lines are looked at as fortifi-
cations which were to be levelled.
