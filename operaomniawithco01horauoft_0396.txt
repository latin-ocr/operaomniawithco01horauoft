Capaciores affer hue, puer, scyphos ·
Et Chia vina aut Lesbia:

Vel, quod fluentem nauseam coerceat, 35
Metire nobis Caecubum:

Curam metumque Caesaris rerum iuvat
Dulci Lyaeo solvere.

‘Pnommmcon immeo pomam! Contrast it with the beginning of Od. 1. 3.
Very little is known of Maevius beyond the fact of his being the special enemy of
Virgil as well as of Horace. ‘Qui Bavium non odit amet tua carmina, Maevi,'

Ecl. 3. 90. The few doubtful stories connected with him will be found in Smith’ss
Dict. Biog. under the name of Bavius.

‘Bad luck go with the ship that bears Maevius. May each wind play its part
in wrecking it. May never a star show itself. Be the sea as rough as when Pallas
sank Ajax on his way home from Troy. Methinks 1 see the storm—the sailors

toiling and you pale and praying as the hull goes to pieces. May you be thrown
on shore and seed the cormorants.’

MALA soluta navis exit alite, '
Ferens olentem Maevium:
Ut horridis utrumque verberes latus,
Auster, memento fluctibus!
Niger rudentes Eurus inverso mari 5
F ractosque remos differat ;
Insurgat Aquilo, quantus altis montibus
Frangit trementes ilices3
