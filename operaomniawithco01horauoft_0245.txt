Iracundior Hadria,

Tecum viv,ere amem, tecum obeam libens.

as Bentley thinks, ‘ from my house,’ so
as to correspond with ‘patet ianua
Lydiae? It is hard to be sure of the
exact metaphor felt in ‘excutitur‚' or
even whether it and ‘patet ianua’ are

The poet personates a lover singing under his mistress’ window on a frosty

night, and appealing to her pity to let him in.
” pride; you have no right from your origin to give yourself the airs of a Penelope.

‘Venus will resent and punish your

Though no human feelings—gratitude, pity, jealousy-—will make you love me,
yet as a goddess be merciful. O, hard and cruel heartl there are limits to your

lover’s patience?

Compare with the Ode 4. 13, which seems to be the revenge which is here

, ‘Rhodani potor'; 4. 15. 13 ‘qui Danu-

bium bibunt.’ The form of expres-
sion is as old as Hom. Il. 2. 825 πίνον-

Scythian, with a husband as stern'as'
husbands are there.¹ Cp.·3. 24. 20-25
