ODE IX.

⁶ Do not despise the office of the lyric poet, Lollius. Pindar’s poems live, unex-
tinguished by Homer's greater name; and so do those of Simonides, Alcaeus,
Stesichorus, Anacreon, Sappho. Before Homer sang, many a Helen loved, many
a Troy was besieged, many a Hector or Deiphobus fought and-died for wife and
children. Why are they unwept, unknown? Because they had no inspired chroni-
cler; and, when once forgotten, what good is left of their heroisin? It shall not

be so with you, Lollius, if 1 can help it. You have the mind osa statesman—clear ¹

sighted, well balanced, proof against avarice, ruler of all things, because it 1111oe
itself. Such is the one wise and happy man, who is independent of circumstances,
who can use prosperity well, and not shrink from poverty or death in a good

Lollius (‘ M. Lollius M. Ἐξ His cognomen is unknown, see on Epp. 1. 2. 1)
’ had been consul ac, 21 (Epp. 1. 20. 28). For his temporary defeat by the Sygam-
bri in ιο. 16 see Introd. to this Book. His character stands very low with
„ other writers. Pliny, H. N. 9. 35. 58, and Vell. Patere. 2. 9, accuse him specially
of avarice and venality. This is in strange contradiction to Horace’s panegyric. in*
which such stress is laid on his sreedom from these particular vices. The public
voice can hardly, at the time Horace wrote, have endorsed the accusations. or the
boldness of meeting Lollius' calumniators on their own ground would have raised
ridicule rather than sympathy. Something no doubt must be deducted from Vel-.
leius' testimony on the scote of his partiality to Tiberius, whose enmity Lollius
had specially incurred (Suet. Tib. 12, 13), and Pliny would very likely have followed
Velleius. But Lollius, notwithstanding the failure of his German campaign, <30¹1-
tinued in the intimacy and -confidenee of Augustus, as is shown by the fact that he
