258 INTRODUCTION TO THE

of the old affection ; but (1) we have no hint now of his being still
interested in polities, a change which tallies with the date assigned by
Dio (54. 19) to his loss of Augustus' favour and retirement from
public affairs in B. c. 16; and (2) he is no longer the patron to whose
praise Horace looks as his highest reward. The three Books of Odes
have been published for some time, and the verdict anticipated in
3. 30 has been accorded to them. Their author is now the intimate
of Augustus. He has been selected to compose the hymn for the
Secular Games, and the public voice ratified the emperor's choice.
He is now writing, ⁴not in the hope of winning a name for himself, but
at Augustus’ desire, and because his praise will consessedly give lustre
to the emperor and his family.

It may be added, that the versification of the leading Odes gives
some witness to the lateness of their composition ; the Sapphic Odes
in the frequeney of the hexemimeral caesura, which assimilates thern
to the Carm. Sec. ; and the AlcaIc in the greater strictness with respect
to the structure of v, 3 of the stanza, and the complete exclusion of
the short anacrusis in vv, 1, 2, 3 (see Index of Metres).

It has been said before (p. 8) that Book iv exhibits more proofs ’
of artistic purpose in its arrangement than any other collection of
Horace's poems.

1·. The most obvious instance, perhaps, is the disposition· of the
four Odes for the sake of which we may say the Book was composed.
They stand in two pairs (evidently not on any chronological ground,
for Ode 6 must be at least two years earlier than any of them) at the
beginning of the Book (after a prelude, which will be noticed pre-
sently) and at its end. Each pair is divided between Augustus and
one of the young princes; so that any praises of the latter may seem
to lead up to and merge themselves in the glory of the former.

2. Scarcely less noticeable is the sequence of thought expressed or
suggested in the three Odes which precede the main theme. It has
been remarked before (p. 9) that a somewhat similar relation may be
traced in the first Ode⁴ of Book i ; but the prelude here is more
elaborate, and the irony is more eonscious. He has been asked to
take up his lyre again to sing the glory of the emperor and his step-
sons, and he begins as usual with ‘ denial vain and coy excuse! ‘ He
will take his lyre, indeed, but it is at Venus' bidding, to renew under
her' compulsion the bitter-sweet themes which he hoped he had laid
aside.’ Ode 2 is to the same purport, though it carries us a. little
further by the end. ‘He is no swan of Pindaric song, such as is
needed for so high a task. Some greater poet, Antonius himself,
