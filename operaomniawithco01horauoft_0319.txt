words with religious associations. The
editors are divided on the question
whether the sentence should be stopped‚
as in the text, the construction being
‘ quid mens rite nutrita . . quid indoles rite
nutrita . . posset ’; or with the comma after
‘mens‚' so that the construction would
be ⁴ quid mens posset, quid indoles rite
nutrita‚’ etc, a distinction being made
between their mental gffts, which were
all their own, and their dispositions,
which needed the good training of
'Augustus Sense, rhythm, and the
balance of the verse are alike in favour
of the former. For ‘posset,· ‘nutrita‚’
with two subjects, see on 1. 3. 10.

29. fortibus et. bonis, the ablative

with ‘creantun’ as with ‘nasci,' etc. ·

‘Fortis et bonus’ is almost a formula;
Epp. 1. 9. 13 ‘et fortem crede bonum-
que.‘ Ritter draws attention to the

conjunction ‘Nerones fortes,' etc., as μ

meaning, ‘remember they were Neros
’,ῖο begin with: the name Nero being,
according to Suetonius (Tib. 1), a

·. Sabine adjective· signifying ‘fortis ac

strenuus.' Notice also that ‘ Nerones?
is the climax—Augustus' care, care
fatherly‚ care spent on such a good
stock. The thought is, ‘ lt is true that
scions of a good stock must be good in
men as well as in animans, but yet edu-
canon-improves the native gift.’ Bentley
pdi'n't's out that a misunderstanding of
the first line of the stanza‚ as thopgh the
point was that given good children you
may be sure they had good parents (in-
stead of as it is, that given good parents

you may be sure of good children), led

“ 1.17. 10.

to the false punctuation of· many MSS.
and editions, which put a comma aster
⁶ fortibus'; so that -‘ bonis ⁷ becomes an
epithet of ⁴ iuvencis: and- the sentiment
of v. 30, instead¹ of being general, ‘ good
blood tells in bullocks and in horses,' is
narrowed to ‘good bullocks and horses
owe their good qualities to their sires!
As Bentley observes, if this were right,
the eagles and the doves ought to change
cases, for the important fact then would
be, that a dove did not breed eagles, not
that eagles did not breed doves.

30. est, ‘survives,' is something real.

35, 36. When there is a collapse of
public manners (so that good education
becomes impossible), good— birth is no
protection against the taint.

35. utcunque=‘ simulac '3 see on

37. indecorant. The MSS. vary
between this word and ‘ dedecorant.'
The Scholiasts support ‘ indecorant,'
which, as th} rarer word, was the least
likely to be substituted. It is found in
a fragment of Accius.

38. Metaurum fiumen, as ‘ flum'en
Rhenum,' A. P. 18. The battle of the
Meta-urus (a river of Umbria) was
fought in nse. 207, by the consuls C.
Claudius Nero and M. Livius Salinator
(both ancestors of Drusus, one through
his father, the other through‘his mother,
Livia), 'against Hasdrubal, who was
bringing reinsorcements to his brother
Hanniba13 Liv. 27. 45 foll.

39. pulcher die83 4. 2. 46 ‘O sol
pulcher ! ⁹ The daylight is at once literal
and metaphorical.
