LIB. 111. OD. 23. 233
Ι Mollivit aversos Penates
Farre pio et saliente mica. 20

purity of the hand which offers the
acceptable gift may be assumed by the

ἒ · poet, but it is not expressed. The doc-

trine* is simply that the gods do not
look for costly offerings from humble
worshippers. If ‘immunis' meant ⁸ im-
munis scelerum,' it would be the most
weighty word in the Ode, and Horace
would not have left his readers to make
up the distinetive part of its meaning by

» conjecture. The three last lin'es of the

stanza have been* construed variously.
The interpretation given above is that
followed by Orelli, Ritter, and Dillr.
Bentley took ‘sumptuosa hostia’ as a
nominative, defending the Ξ. eitlfer as
lengthened by the following ‘bl,' or as
the parallel of ‘ si non periret immisera-
bilis: 3. 5. 1 7, q. v. ‘ A co‘stly victim does
not soothe the displeasure of the Penates
more winningly than,’ etc.

19. mollivit, not an aoristic, but a
regular perfect, as is shown by the con-
ditional clause to which it answers: ‘if

. the offering has been made, the gods

are satisfied.’ Several of the best MSS.
have ‘mollibit' [and it is so quoted by
Servius], but the perfect is supported,
by Stat. Silv. 1. 3. 130 ‘ deis . . Caespes
et exiguo placuerunt. sarra salino‚’ Ti·
bull. 4. 1. 14 ‘Parvaque caelestes pla-
cavit mica‘ (both quoted by Keller),
which seem like imitations; and we
may probably follow Bentley in refusing Ι
to admit what would be a solitary in-
stance in Horace of this form of the

future in a doubtful reading, and against ,
the silence of the old grammarians, ἓ

who are quick to notice any such

-varieties.

20. A periphrasis for the ¹ mola salsa‚’
‘fruges salsae: Virg. Aen. 2. 13 3. The
commentators say, but scarcely prove,
that the crackling of the salt in the fire
was taken for a good omen. If so, the
two epithets will really characterise
both substantives‚ and mean, ‘duly offered
and kindly received! The expression
is imitated Ov, Fast. 4. 409, Tibull.
