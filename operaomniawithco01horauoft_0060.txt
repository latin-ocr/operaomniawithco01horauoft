‘WE have seen and felt enough of the wrath of the gods. Our population is ’ὲ
thinned by civil war, while the Parthians desy us in safety. What god can save ’ ³
our falling empire‚ or atone for our guilt ⁰? Apollo? Venus ? our father Mars ἰ’ nay ’ᾗ
rather Mercury, who is amongst us in human shape, and submitting to be mlled ' Ξ
Caesar’s avenger—you, Augustus, you must be our prince. Long may you live-- . 3
stay the civil war, and chastise the Parthians 1 ’ *g
This is one os the Odes which seem ‘to challenge us by the definiteness of their ἐξ
historical allusions to find their date, and which yet baffle us is we attempt to do “
so. That the portents referred to in vv. 1—20 are those which followed the death
of Julius Caesar, Rc. 44 (Dio C. 45. 17, Virg. G. 1.466 foll„ Tib. 2. 5, 71 foll„ .›
Ov. Met. 15. 782 foll.)‚ seems certain from vv. 18. 44„ although Horace stands
alone in mentioning the inundation of the Tiber, Dio and Virgil only speaking of ’
the Po. That the Ode was not written at that time is still more certain. Augustus 2
did not then occupy the whole horizon of politics. Horace was at Athens, and ’
on the point of joining the army of Brutus. Franke places its composition in mc. f j
29, when Augustus returned to Rome aster the victory of Actium, and celebrated ·
his threesold triumph (see v. 49). Dio (53. 4) makes Augustus assert that his
mission had been τῷ πατρὶ δεινῶς σφαγέντι τιμωρῆσαι as well as τὴν πόλιν ἐκ μεγά- ,,
λων καὶ ἐπαλλήλων κακῶν ἐξελέσθαι. And the temple of Mars Ultor, of which the ’
fayade probably still stands, in the forum os Augustus, was built in fulfilment of a ⁷
vow made by him, ‘ bello Philippensi pro ultione paterna suscepto,' Suet. Octav.
29 ; cp. Ov. Fast. 5. 569. If Horace identifies sor a moment the ‘scelus expian- ³
dum ¹ with the death os Caesar, his thoughts at least are not running on any cruel ³
vengeanee when he sees in the avenger the incarnation of ‘ gentle Maia's son? the:
god of peaceful arts, of prudence and persuasion, of commerce and wealth. ,

Compare with the whole poem Virg. G. 1. 466 to the end—a complete parallel -
both in sentiment and expression.
