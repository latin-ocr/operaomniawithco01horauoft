HORATII CARMINUM

Aut Epheson bimarisve Corinthi
Moenia vel Baccho Thebas vel Apolline Delphos
Insignes aut Thessala Tempe.
Sunt quibus unum opus est, intactae Palladis urbem 5
Carmine perpetuo celebrare et
Undique decerptam fronti praeponere olivam. ’
Plurimus in Iunonis honorem
Aptum dicet equis Argos ditesque Mycenas.
Me nec tam patiens Lacedaemon ιο
Nec tam Larissae percussit campus opimae,
Quam domus Albuneae resonantis

or ‘glorious'3 Catull. 4. 8 ‘nobilem
Rhodum.'

5. sunt quibus, see on Od. 1. 1. 3.

6. perpetuo, a continuous poem not
merely touching incidentally on Athens,
Ov. Met. 1. 4 ‘ prima ab origine mundi
In mea perpetuum deducite tempora
carmen.

7. ‘To wreathe their brow with the
olive plucked on every hand‚’ i. e. to
seek fame by writing on a well-worn
theme. This is Bentley's interpreta-
tion. The expression contains a remi-
niscence of Lucret. 1. 926 ‘iuvat . . novos
decerpere flores, Insignemque meo ca-
piti petere inde coronam Unde prius
nulli velarint tempora Musae? a pas-
sage which Horace imitates again in
Od. 1. 26. 6, 7. The ‘olive’ leaf is
specially named as the appropriate
crown for one who wrote of Athens:
Bentley quotes Sen. Herc. F. 913 ‘ Po-
pulea nostras arbor exornet cornaS‚
Te ramus oleae fronde gentili tegat,
Theseu!

undique, ‘by every one,’ parallel to
the use of ‘ unde‘ =‘ a qu0‚' of the agent,
Sat. 1. 6. 12, etc. All other interpre-
tations are more forced. Orelli takes
it ‘ to pluck the olive for a crown from
every quarter of Attic soil‚' i. e. to sing
of every myth, event, glory of art, that
adorn Athens.

8. plurimus. There seems to be no
other instance of ‘plurimus’ without a
subst. for ‘plurimi.' Ritter wssl not
allow the use, and takes ‘ plurimus in
Iunonis honorem’ as=‘effusus in,' as
‘multus esse in re nota,' Cic.v de Or.
2. 87. But if Virgil says ‘plurimus
oleaster: G. 2 182, and Lucan, 3. 707,
⁴ multus sua vulnera. puppi Affixit mo-

riens'3 ‘plurimus' may well be used ’ἕ

sor the plural here.
in honorem, for the accus. cp. Epod.
1. 24 ‘ militabitur in tuae spem gratiae!
9. aptum equis, ἱππόβοτον, ἱπποτρό-
φον, Hom. ; ‘ rarum pec‘orique et vitibus

i

almis Aptius uber erit.' Virg. G. 2. 234.

dites Mycenas, πολυχρύσους, 11. 8.
180. '

l‘1o. patiens, of the Spartan disci—
p me.

11. percussit, as we say, ‘has so
smitten me,’ has made such an impres·
sion on me.

opimae, Homer's ἐριβῶλαξ Λάρισσα,
11. 2. 841 ; ‘opimae Sardiniae segetes:
Od. 1. 31. 3‚Virg. Aen. 2. 782.

12. domus Albuneae. See Mr.
Burn’s account of Tivoli in ⁸ Rome and
the Campagna‚’ p. 394 fou.. He iden·
tifies it not with the ‘temple of the
Sibyl‚' as it is commonly called, but
with the second ancient temple, now the
church of S. G‘iorgio,which stands close
to it on the brink of the precipitous
ravine through which the ⁸ old sall’ os
the Anio deseends. The topography of
Tibur is especially difficult on account
of the changes which great inundations
have caused in the course of the Anio.
One such is described in Plin. Epp. 8.
17. Another, in Ab. 1826, led to the
excavation of the tunnels through the
Monte Catillo. by which the

part of the river is now conducted to ’.ᾗ

the ‘ new falls ’ beyond the reach of the
rocks.0n which the town is built.-

resonantis, echoing from the cata· j

raet close by. Albunea was the last of

the Sibyls. Mr. Burn thinks that- Virg. Τ

Aen. 7. 82 ‘lucosque sub alta Consuht
Albunea‚' etc„ refers not to Tibur but
