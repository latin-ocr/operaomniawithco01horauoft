128 HORATII CARMINUM

ODE VII.

‘WnAr, Pompeius at home again safe in limb and rights! Pompeius who
shared with me the dangers and the snatched pleasures of the campaign under
Brutus. After Philippi we separated. Mercury carried me off in sasety, you were
swept back again into the war. Surely you owe Jove a feastzof thanksgiving. My
lawn shall be the scene of the revel. Who would think of sobriety when a lost
friend is found? ⁹

  
    
   
   
     
 
   

⁶ Ad Pompeium Varum‚’ Acr.; and so the Ode is inscribed in the oldest MSS.
Nothing is known of Pompeius. He has been by some editors wrongly identified
’with Pompeius Grosphus, the n'ch owner of pastures in Sicily, Epp. 1. 12. 21, od.
2. 16.

At what point of the civil war Pompeius abandoned it and availed himself of au
offered amnesty, or what interval had elapsed since then, there is no indication. κ ·
Horace writes as if he had heard nothing of his old friend for some years, and he
has by this time a lawn of his own on which he can entertain a guest. The name
of Pompeius suggests that he may have followed, after the battle of Philippi, the
fortunes of Sextus Pompeius, who maintained the war by sea against the Triumvirs
till the year nc. 35.
