136 ’ HORATII CARMINUM

,ί (Dio 54. 3), of a conspiracy with Fannius Caepio, and, in spite of the efforts of
ε’ ‘Proculeius his brother (see on Od. 2. 2. 5), and Maecenas. his brother-in-law’
ἒ (Dio l. c.), was put to death. In the character given of him (ἀκράτῳ καὶ κατακορεΐ
παρρησίᾳ πρὸς πάντας ὁμοίως ἐχρῆτο, see Dio 1. c.‚ who tells a story of his boldnaes
of speech towards Augustus himself) we may probably see the appropriatenaes of

Horace‘ 5 persuasive to moderation.

here both the mean estate and the

‘tutus’ belongs to the first clause,
‘sobrius’ to the second; ‘he avoids the

is sober and avoids the palace that
raises envy’; but in sense, ⁴⁴ sober and
