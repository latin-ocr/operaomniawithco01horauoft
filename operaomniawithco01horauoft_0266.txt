H ORATII CARMINUM

Da lunae propere novae,
Da noctis mediae, da, puer, auguris κ»>
Murenae: tribus aut novem
Miscentur cyathis pocula commodis.
Qui Musas amat impares,
⁷ Ternos ter cyathos attonitus petet
Vates; tres prohibet supra 15
Rixarum metuens tangere Gratia
Nudis iuncta sororibus.
Insanire iuvat: cur Berecyntiae
Cessant flamina tibiae?
Cur pendet tacita* fistula cum lyra? ιο
Pascentes ego dexteras μ
Odi: sparge rosas; audiat invidus
Dementem strepitum Lycus ’
Et vicina seni non habilis Lyco.

9. lunae novae3 Od. 3. 23. 2 ‘nas-
centeluna‚' where see note. The‘ new
³ moon ’ means apparently the first of the
month, on which a feast was usual, as
in Greek νουμηνία was transferred by
usage so completely from the first of
the natural lunar mouth to the first

of the calendar month, that the real'

new moon was expressed by νουμηνία
,κατὰ τὴν σελήνην, Thuc. 2. 28. For
the genitive see on 3. 8. 13 ‘cyathos
amici sospitis)
10. noetis mediae ; 3. 28. 16.
11. Horace assumes the function of
‘ arbiter bibendi ’· (Dict. Ant. s. v. ⁵ sym-
posium')‚ and proceeds (not to give
orders to the servants, so there is no
need with Rutgers and Bentley to alter
‘ miscentur ’ to ⁴ miscentor‚’ but) to an-
nounce to the guests the proportions in
which the wine and water are mixed.
Itis a disputed point whether ⁴ cyathus ’
was a name of the ladle used for mix-
ing: cp. Sat. 1. 6. 117. In any case it
was a measure of capacity, the twelfth
of the sextan’us, which was nearly equal
to our pint. The meaning will therefore
be: that the wine and water may be
mlxed in the proportion of 9 to 3 or
2 3 to 9.
. . 12. commodis is rendered by Orelli
‘ mtegris? ‘ plenum modum habentibus,’
' aster Plautus' ‘commodas minas‚’ i. e.
’ of full weight 3 but it is perhaps better

taken by Ritter as an adjective for an
adverb, ‘to suit the taste of *the drinkers.' Δ

13—17. It is a question whether this
is a double description of the two
classes of drinkers spoken of in vv. 11,
12, the ‘rapt poet, withhis love for the
ask for nine parts of wiiffis‘a‘fid those
who think rather of the Graoes and
their decorous serus of quarrels, and
therefore keep to three; or a further
statement about the oue class who
prefer the stronger mixture, ‘They are
moved by two motives, their love of the
nine Muses, which makes them asksor
the full nine parts of wine, and their
regard for the decorous Graues, which
restrains them from taking the additional
three which would make the liquor
“merum’''. In the first mse ‘tres
supra ’ (for their order cp. 3. 3. 11 ⁸ quos
inter ¹) must mean ⁶ more ' ·
in the latter case ‘ three further?
