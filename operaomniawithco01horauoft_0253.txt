itself certainly suggests such a locality. The poet seems to be at home at the
spring. The surrounding objects are too familiar to obtrude themselves on the
picture. The spring, now called ‘ Fontana degli ,Oratini,’ on the hill-side between
the two suggested sites for Horace’s farm, answers well enough to the description.
It gushes out suddenly at the bottom of a small face of rock, crowned now, not by
ilex, but by a fig—tree, and its rush‘ of cold water, the crystal clearness of the basin
which it forms, and then the. life with which it starts to bound and prattle down
the steep slope to the valley are quite enough to wake apoet’s enthusiasm. On
the other hand. it has been shown that as late as the 12th century there was a
church standing on a site which can be identified about six miles south of Venusia,

which is named in ecclesiastical documents of the time as ‘ Eccl. SS. MM. Gervasi ι·

et Protasi in Bandusino Fonte apud Venusiam.' If this evidence be held conclusive
we must either suppose that Horace writes from an affectionate memory of the
Bandusian spring, such as he elsewhere shows of Mount Vultur, the nestling village
of Acherontia, and other spots near the home of his boyhood; or, if ‘cras dona-
beris' seems too definite for a mere address of fancy, we must conclude that at
some period in his life he revisited Venusia. Α The fact, however, that he does not
himself indicate the locality of the ⁸ Fons Bandusiae’ may have caused topographers
to make various guesses in early times as well as late, and the Venusian claimant
of the name need not be the genuine one. Verses 2-8 are probably interpreted of
the Fontanalia, a festival'on Oct. 12, named by Varro, Ling. Lat. 5, ‘in fontes
coronas iaciunt et puteos coronant!

2. mero, floribus, haedo. These
seem to be three distinct offerings.
For the flowers see the account of the
Fontanalia quoted above. For the wine
and the sacrifice cp. Ov. Fast. 3. 300
foll. ‘ Huc ‘venit et fonti rex Numa
mactat ovem, Plenaque odorati disponit
poeula Bacchi.’

pose is to describe the age of the kid.
Granted that a deity (and the spring is

mised ceremony as well as by its ritual
exactness. Perhaps we may add that
as the victim was after all for the eating,
not of gods, but of men, the religious
ceremony being not much more than a
‘grace before meat,’ the offerer would
take an interest in the delicacy of the
offering. and would moralize with more
complacency on the irony of its fate.
