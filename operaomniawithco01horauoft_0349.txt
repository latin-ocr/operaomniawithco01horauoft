LIB. Ν. OD. 14. 307

ODE XIV. ⁹

⁸ How can senate and people worthily honour thy virtues, Augustus, and trans-
mit their memory to all time? The triumphs of the Nero brothers, of Drusus over
the Vindelici, the Genauni and Breuni, of Tiberius over the Raeti, are all owing to
thy auspices. How terrible was Tiberius in the pursuit; as the south wind on the
waters, or as the river Aufidus when it pours in a torrent from the hills down on
the plain. Thine were the plan and provision of the campaign, thine its divinely—
ordered success for the victory came on a day already noteworthy for thy happy
fortune—just fifteen years after the capture of Alexandria. Thy reign has been
a series of triumphs, and now all the world* 1s at thy feet?

For some account of Tiberius’ campaign in Β. c. 15 see Introd. to the Book.

QUAE cura patrum quaeve Quiritium¹
⁴Pieriis honorum muneribus tuas,
Αυςυεῖὲ virtutes in aevum
Per titulos memoresque fastos
Aeternet, o, qua sol¹ habitabiles 5
Illustrat oras, maxime principum?
Quem legis expertes Latinae
Vindelici didicere nuper,

1. patrum . . Quiritium. Horace
analyses and gives a poetical form to
the common formula for the authority
by which such titles or honours would

be conferred, S. P. Q. R.
2. plenis=‘iustis‚’ ‘adequate.’ No

. heaping upon him of offiees and honorary

titles will be sufficient for his merits.
The force of the adjective must overflow
on the other clauses, as the general
thought is, ‘ how can we adequately
honour you now, or secure you the im-
mortality of honour which you deserve‘?’
A genitive of the object with ‘ munus ' is
not common; but cp. 1. 28. 3 ‘ pulveris
exigui munera!

4. titulos, inscriptions on monuments
and public buildings; 4. 8. 13.

memores fastos ; 3. 17. 4.

5. aeternet, an archaic word, found
in a fragment of Varro.

qua= ‘ over the whole space in which.’
Ov. Met. 1. 241 ‘qua terra patet sera
regnat Erinnys? Virg. Aen. 7. 99 ⁶ nepo-
tes Omnia sub pedibus, qua Sol utrum-

regique videbunt?

habitabiles oras, a translation of ἡ
οἰκουμένη.

6. maxime principum, not as
though‘ princeps' had yet become a
general title for a ruler' ln any time or
people‚ as we might say ‘greatest of
princes, 'but only a hyperbolical form
of‘ maxime p1·inceps.'1t is himself
and his own office that is generalized:
Horace cannot conceive a greater
than him in his own character.
For the title ‘princeps’ see on 1.
2. 50.

7. quem . . didicere . . quid posses,
a familiar idiom in Greek, Soph. Ο. T.
15 ὁρᾶς μὲν ἡμᾶς ἡλίκοι προσήμεθα, the
subject of the subordinate verb being
attracted into the accusative, as though
it were the direct object of the leading
verb. It is imitated frequently by Teg-
rence‚ as in Eun 3. 5. 18‘ me noris
quam elegans siem, ’.Madv 5439, obs. 1.
The general expression ‘didicere quid
posses ' answers to 4. 4. 23-28 ‘ sensere

que recurrens Aspicit Oceanum vertique quid posset!
