LIB.1. OD. 34. ” ’ ¹ 97

O D E XXXIV.

‘ Ι sumnum my old Epicurean doctrine of the ‘¹ careless'’ gods (Sat. 1. 5. 101).
Ι have heard thunder not where Lucretius might explain it to me from clashing
clouds, but in a cloudless sky, where I could not but recognise it as the rolling of
the chariot wheels that shake all creation. 1t is the same hand that launches
“bolts from a clear sky ” in human things, that lifts the humble and overthrows

the proud when men least expect it?

Horace is thinking probably of the challenge with which Lucretius clenches his
argument that thunder comes from purely natural causes :—

‘ Denique cur nunquam caelo iacit undique puro
Iuppiter in terras fulmen sonitusque profundit?’—6. 400.

The notable changes of fortune in his mind at the time are very possibly the vicissi-
tudes of Phraates and Tiridates on the Parthian throne (see Introd. to Odes i—iii, § 8),
⁷ though the expressions in vv. 14 foll. are not particular enough to necessitate this
Α interpretation. The framework of the Ode bears some resemblance to that of
⁵ 1. υς each centering round a circumstance in the poet’s pexsonal experience. This
in both cases stands in the middle of the Ode, introduced by the emphatic
‘namque’ (1. 22. 9): it is the ground of the statements that precede and follow.
¹ What he has witnessed in this case, and the cause to which alone he can trace it4
.justify both the general recantation of stanza 1, and the solution which he gives in
stanza 4 of the difficulty in the human world which seems to him analogous to
the thunder, for which no ‘secondary cause’ was to be found, in the material

q world.

PARCUS deorum cultor et infrequens,

 

Ιῃὲἓῃίεηῒὶε dum sapientiae
Consultus erro, nunc retrorsum
Vela dare atque iterare cursus

2. insanientis sapientiae, σοφίαι
ἅσόφουι the oxymoron is continued in
‘consultus erro ἐ σοφία or ‘sapientia' is
the special name that Lucretius claims

γ for the Epicurean system, ‘vitae ratio-
: hem . . eam quae nunc appellatur sapien-
tia‚' 5. 10, cp. 2. 7 ⁶ doctrina sapientum.'
.⁷ 3. consultus, asused commonly with
''iux-is,' meant one whose opinion was
, ὲουςὴῒ, and so an adept, a professor.
Hvy had led the way in transferring it
. to- other arts, fiuris atque eloquentiae
¹ oonsultusss 10. 22.
. 4. iter-are cursus relictos, ‘to steer

again in the course I had deserted,’ i. e.
to return to the ways of thought to
which Ι was accustomed before I learnt
Epicureanism. Bentley, disliking the
expression ‘relinquere cursus’ (relius
quere viam’ he thinks would be right,
but ‘intermittere cursum ’), and attracted .
by the frequent use by the later poets
of ‘ relegere ' with ‘ cursus) ‘viarm' etc.
(cp. Virg. Aen. 3. 690 ‘ relegens errata
retrorsum Litora ⁹), wished to read, ex
mera coniectura, ‘ relectos‚' which would
be predicative, ‘to retrace and travel

again: etc.
