HORATII CARMINUM

Occultare meis dicerer horreis,
Magnas inter opes inops.
Purae rivus aquae silvaque iugerum
Paucorum et segetis certa fides meae 30
Fulgentem imperio fertilis Africae
Fallit sorte beatior.
Quamquam nec Calabrae mella ferunt apes
Nec Laestrygonia Bacchus in amphora
Languescit mihi nec pinguia Gallicis 35
Crescunt vellera pascuis, ⁶

a se ipso: and so asz‘non possessae,’
making it an oxymoron answering to
‘inter opes inops’: the poor man pos-
sessing all thinhs though he has nothing,
the rich man a-‘pauper in the midst of
his richeS.

the height of wealth see on 1. 1. 9 ‘ si

26. quiequid arat, the fruits of his
ploughing. Strabo (6, p. 284) speaks
of the plains of North Apulia as πάμ-
φοροί τε καὶ πολύφοροι, but we hear of
them chiefly as used for pasture. Pos-
sibly Horace, in want of the name of
a corn-growing Italian district, might
insert Apulia without weighing its pre-
tensions very nicely (see on 1. 22. 13).
He singles out the industry of the
husbandman rather than the fertility
of the soil. For the lengthening of
tlge Iast syllable of ⁴ arat' see 011 1. 3.

site is ‘fundus mendax‚’ 3. 1. 30. Cp.
Virg. G. 1. 226 ‘illos Expectata seges
vanis elusit aristis?

31. Constr. ‘fallit beatior sorte (λαν-
θάνει ὀλβιωτέρα οὖσα) fulgentem fertilis
Africae imperio‚’ ‘is a lot happier than
his, though he cannot see it, who glitters
in the lordship os fertile Africa.' This
seems to be a hyperbolical way of
descnbing a man who owns wide corn-

lands in Africa, as another is said in

v. 41 to ⁶ join in one sweep the kingdom
of Alyattes to the broad plains of
Phrygia.' Cp. 2. 2. 10-12 ‘si Libyam
remotis Gadibus iungas et uterque Poe-
nus Serviat uni‚’ and read with this the
note there. Ritter takes ⁶ fertilis Africae ’“
with ‘ sorte‚’ comparing ⁴ Sors Asiae' =

‘ the proconsulship of Asia‚' Tac. Ann.

the proconsulship of rich Africa, though
he cannot see it who is in the dazzling

the glory of power, we lose the force of
the epithet ‘fertilis ' and of the direct
comparison with the poet’s few acres
and certain omps, If we emphasize ⁶ fer-
tilis: as irnplying that the proconsul of
Africa has the opportunity of enriching
himself, ‘ fulgentem imperio ' loses much

“great extent out of the context.
