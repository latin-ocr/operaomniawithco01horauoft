LIB. ΙΙΙ. OD. 8.

Ο DE VIII.v

Tmz Ode is written for an expected or imagined visit of Maecenas, on the first
anniversary of the poet's narrow escape from the falling tree (2. 13. 2. 17. 27, 3. 4.
27). The festival of March 1 was the Matronalia. Maecenas is supposed on his
entry to wonder what can be the reason that a bachelor's home shows preparation
for sacrifice on such a day. The answer is, that the poet is paying a vow to Bac-
chus, which he had made at the time of his miraculous preservation. ‘The best
wine is to be brought out,’ and so the Ode passes into an invitation to Maecenas
to enter into the spirit of the time—to forget the troubles of State. ‘All is going
well 3 the Dacians are checked, the Parthians quarrelling among themselves, evenv

the Cantabrian subdued at last, and the Scythians unstringing their bows; Mae· ‚

cenas may enjoy a little privacy and immunity from care.’
On the questions raised as to the date of the Ode· see Introd. to Books i-iii, ξ 8.
