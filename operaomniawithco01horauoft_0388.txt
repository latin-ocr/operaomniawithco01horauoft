346 HORATII EP'ODON

-EPODE VI.

‘Yon are like awatch-dog who flies at a guest but is afraid of a wolf. Turn
your impotent attack on me: I have teeth; I follow my quarry to the death.
Yon bark loud enough, but will turn aside for a piece of meat. Bewaoe, Ι am
a bull with sharp horns, and ready to attack those who deserve it, as ready as
Archilochus or Hipponax. Ι will not take an insult.’

In assailing the wrong use of the poetry of invective, Horace indicates its right
use. The misuser of iambic verse attacks the innocent and defenceless, and is
ready to be bought off. What can we wish better than that he should provoke
the true wielder of Archilochus' weapon and be the object instead of the writer of
>an Epode ¹?

The person intended is not known. Acron calls him ¹ Cassium maledicum
poetam.’ The Comm- Cruq. further identifies him with Cassius Severus, an orator
of name (Quint. 10. 1. 177), but a libellous writer (Tac. Ann. 1. 72). He is known
to have died An). 32, and it is perhaps hardly probable that he can have written
lampoons such as to attract Horace's anger (as this would oblige us to suppose)
at the least sixty-three years before. Nor is there any hint elsewhere of his having
»been a poet. Ritter suggests Furius Bibaculus. who is elsewhere ridiculed by
Horace (see on Sat. 1. 10. 37, 2. 5. 41), and who is classed with Catullus by Quin- ν
tilian (10. 1. 96) as a writer of bitter ⁶ iambi,' ‘ [iambi] cuius acerbitas in Catullo,
Bibaculo, non in Horatio reperietur‚’ and who is named by Tac. Anu. 4. 34 as a
lampooner of the Caesarian family.

QUID immerentes hospites vexas canis
Ignavus adversum lupos?
Quin huc inanes, si potes, vertis minas,
Et me remorsurum petis? ,
Nam qualis aut Molossus aut fulvus Lacon, 5

Quaecunque praecedet fera:

3. There is high Ms. authority (in- from Lucretius' ‘permissa canum vis‚'
cluding V) for‘verte'and (although the 4. 681, ‘fida canum vis,' 6. 1222, an
reading of V is not so clear) for ‘petes imitation of the Greek use of βία. The
B has ‘ vertis’ altered to ⁴ verte, and dogs of Epirus and Sparta are named in
‘petes.' No MS. gives the transposition Virg. G. 3. 405. They are used there,

‘verte si potes‚' which is necessary to as here, both for guarding the sold and
