His father’s care, Sat. 1. 4. 105 foll., 1. 6. 71 foll. Study under
Orbilius, ‘plagosus,’ Epp. 2. 1. 69. [There is a short life of
Orbilius Pupillus of Beneventum in Sueton. de Illustr. Gramm.
Horace's epithetis quoted and illustrated by a line of Domitius
Marsus, ‘ Si quos Orbilius ferula scuticaque cecidit.']- For the
subjects of his reading see 1. c. and Epp. 2. 2. 41.

13.c. 44 (?). Studz‘es at Athens.—Epp. 2. 2. 43 foll. [Brutus was at
Athens at the time, immediately after Caesar’s murder, attending
the lectures of Theomnestus the Academic, and Cratippus the
‘Peripatetic, and wishing to be· thought entirely intent on philo-
sophy, Plutarch. Brut. 24.] First literary efforts (?)‚ Sat. 1. 10. 35.

¹ 13.c. 43, 42. Campazgn with Brutus.—Epp. 2. 2. 46 foll., Sat. 1. 6. 48,

Od. 2. 7. 26, Epp. 1. 20. 23. [Sueton. ‘ bello Philippensi excitus
a Marco Bruto imperatore tribunus militum meruit.'] For indi-

13.c. 41. Relurn lo Rome.—‘ Decisis humilem pennis, inopemque pa-

terni Et Laris et fundi‚’ Epp. 2. 2. 49. [Sueton. ‘ Victis partibus,

’ venia impetrata, scriptum quaestorium comparavit.' This means

the place of a ‘ scriba‚’ or clerk, in the quaestor's office, and

Horace’s appointment to it is connected by some with his
father's old employment as ‘ coactor exactionum.’]

· 1³.c. 38 (?). Introduction to Maecenas.—Sat. 1. 6. 54 foll. The date of

 

this is fixed by a comparison of Sat. 2. 6. 40 ‘ Septimus octavo
propior iam fugerit annus, Ex quo Maecenas me coepit habere
suorum In numero,' with the references in vv. 38, 53, 55, which
seem to fix the composition of that Satire to the end of ac. 31.
