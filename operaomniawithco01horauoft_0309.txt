Monte decurrens· velut amnis, imbres 5
Quem super notas aluere ripas,
Fervet immensusque ruit profundo
Pindarus ore,
Laurea donandus Apollinari,
Seu per audaces nova dithyrambos ιο
Verba devolvit numerisque fertur
Lege solutis ;
Seu deos regesque canit, deorum
Sanguinem, per quos cecidere iusta
Morte Centauri, cecidit tremendae 15
Flamma Chimaerae3
Sive quos Elea domum reducit
Palma caelestes pugilemve equumve

Compare with the stanza the way in
which Horace speaks of the enterprise
-when it is undertakeu by a friend, not
offered to himself, Epp. 1. 3. 10 [Titius]
⁶ Pindarici fontis qui non expalluit haus-
tus Fastidire lacus et rivos ausus apertos!

6. quem . . aluere. This seems to
be the certain reading. though the old
Bland. is among a few MSS. which
have 'cum . . saliere? The vulg. was
the reading interpreted by Aer. and the
Comm. Cruq.

7, 8. ⁴ Boils and rushes in a sathomless
flood of words? As so often in Horace,
the interpretation of the simile is clothed
still in language almost wholly meta-
phon'eal and borrowed from the simile
itself, see on Od. 1. 55. 19, 2. 2. 1, 4. 4.
59. ‘Ore’ belongs more to the poet
than to the river, ‘profundo ore' being
the analogue of ‘ ore rotundo: A. P. 32 3.

. ‘magno ore.’ Virg. G. 3. 294, of varie-

ties of poetical style. The epithet, on
the contrary, belongs primarily to the
river, and even ⁸ ore’ is a word which
was probably felt to be capable of an
interpretation in the same connection,
though neither ‘fountain-head' (Virg.
Aen. 1. 245) nor ‘mouth’ (Virg. G. 4.
²9²) is a meaning which would bear
pressing here.

10. audaces covers, probably, bold-
ness of treatment and of tropes, besides
the two points afterwards named-vo-
cabulary and rhythm.

nova verba, novel words long com-
pounds. τῶν δ’ ὄνομάτωιὶ τὰ μὲν διπλᾶ
μάλιστα ἁρμόττει τοῖς διθυράμβοιε, Arist.

Poet. 22. 14.

11. devolvit, as the torrent rolls
boulders down its bed.

12. lege solutis. Two technical
expressions possibly contribute to the
full force of this phrase: (1) ‘ legi-
bus solutus‚’ said of any one exempted
from the operation of any law (Cic.
Phil. 2. 13), in later times of the em-
peror as above the laws (Merivale‚ vol.
iii, p. 466) ; (2) ‘soluta orati0‚' the
common designation of prose, as exempt
from strict laws of prosody; so that the
words of the text form a sort of oxy-
moron, ‘ verse which is as free of law as
if it were not verse! . ι

lerophon, not the kings of Pindar‘s day.
He is speaking of Hymns and Paeans.
⁶ Que ' is the reading of all the best MSS,
as against the vulg. ‘ ve,’ and the change
would hardly be necessary, even if it
were clear that Pindar's Odes on the

those addressed to gods. Horace might
rank them together.

17. Elea palma. *The Olympian ’

mustela.

heaven ’ς see on Ι, 1. 6 ‘terrarum do-
minos evehit ad deos!

equum, as Pindar makes mention of
Pherenicus, Hiero’s horse, Ol. 1. 18,
Pyth. 3. 743 but singing of homes may
well mean of their riders.
