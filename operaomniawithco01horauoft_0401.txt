LIBER. EPOD. 13. ’ 359

EPODE XIII.

‘Ir is stormy weather3 the occasion, if we will take it while we may, sor the
greater merriment within doors. Bring the old wine. Do not let us talk of any
troubles. They will corne straight again. Let us draw the conclusion the Centaur
taught his great pupil to draw. “ You are mortal. You will ῃοῒ come back from
Troy. Enjoy life while you are there.” ’

Compare Od. 1. 9, and see Introd. to it. The poem is addressed to a circle of
friends who seem to have some common care. In v. 6 the poet addresses the
symposiarch. The advice of Chiron to Achilles is not found either in form or sub-

stance in any extant Greek poem. Compare the story of Teucer in Od. 1. 7, of
Prometheus in 1. 16.

HORRIDA tempestas caelum contraxit et imbres
Nivesque deducunt Iovem ; nunc mare, nunc siluae
Threicio Aquilone sonant: rapiamus, amici,
Occasionem de die, dumque virent genua
Et decet, obducta solvatur fronte senectus. 5
Tu vina Torquato move consule pressa meo.
Cetera mitte loqui: deus haec fortasse benigna
Reducet in sedem vice: Nunc et Achaemenio
Perfundi nardo iuvat et fide Cyllenea
Levare diris pectora sollicitudinibu53 10

4. de die. This phrase seems to
have meant ‘ from early in the day‚’
cp. the opp. ‘de nocte,’ Epp. Ι. 2. 32,
and to have been used specially of be-
ginning in the day-time occupations,
such as seasting‚ which belonged to the
evening and night; ‘partem solido de-
mere de die‚' Od. 1. 1. 20, ⁶ Vos convivia
lauta sumptuose De die facitis‚’ Catull.
47. 5, Liv. ²3· 8 ‘epulari de die.’ Here
it is perhaps more general in meaning,
‘ere the day passes‚’ ‘ere evening comes,’

the evening of life as well as of the par-
ticular day.
