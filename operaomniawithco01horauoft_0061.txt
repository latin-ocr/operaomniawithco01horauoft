Seculum Pyrrhae nova monstra questae,

Omne cum Proteus pecus egit altos

5. terruit gentes. The downsall of

flooding of rivers. Cp. the accountof
rain was so great that the world looked

the rise of the Nile, mentioned, thou'gh

  
    
    
   
 
    
      

for a return of Deucalion's deluge ς cp.

“ Virg. G. 1. 468 ‘ Impiaque aeternam
timuerunt saecula noctem.

6. monstra, anything strange and

y portentous; used in Virg. Aen. 3. 582 of

., the noises of Aetna; Aen. 7. 21, of the
transformations wrought by Circe.

questae, as a Greek might have used
ἀγανακτεῖν. The word serves to identify
Pyrrha’s feelings as well as her eircum-
stances with those of the poet. She too
said ‘iam satis: etc.

7. pecus, ‘immania armenta . . pho-
cas? Virg. G. 4. 395.

egit visere, App. 2. ξ 1.

the words are chosen to emphasise the

ς were birds—the deer ‘swim’ as if the}
’ ⁷ were fish.

13. vidimus, not necessarily of per-
, sonal sight, ‘our generation has seen ; ’

’ 'effervere in agros Vidimus undantem
ruptis fornacibus Aetnam?

flavum, Od. 1. 8. 8, 2. 3. 18.—an
habitual epithet, otherwise we might
, ἦ· take it as meaning ⁸ yellower than usual

⁶ - from the flood.’ ‘
ε retortis litore Etrusco, ‘ hurled

·’, ’ back from the shore of the Tuscan sea,’
’· “ i. e. driven back by the wind and so
caused to flood. Horace uses ‘litus
Etruscum’ in two other places in this
, sense, C. S. 38, and Epod. 16. 40. And

Α this was the common explanation os the

not approved, by Herodotus, 2. 20.
So Seneca, Nat. Q. 3. 26 ⁸ si crebrioribus
ventis ostium caeditur et reverberatus
fluctu amnis restitit: qui crescere videtur
quia non effunditur.' ‘Litore Etrusco’
has been otherwise taken os the right
bank of the Tiber, against which the full
stream dashes a'nd is driven back so as
to flood the lower left bank, ‘sinistra
‘ Litus ’ is used for a river
bank in Virg. Aen. 3. 390, 8. 83.

15. monumenta regis would pro-
perly include both the ‘ Atrium Vestae,'
also called ‘ Regia! the residence of
the Pontifex Maximus, and the temple
of Vesta, which was attached to it:
both were attributed to King Numa.
The ‘ que,’ however, does not couple so
much the names of two separate build-
ings as the two interests, historic and
religious‚ that attach to the same block
of building. Note that the identifica-
tion of the cause of the flood with the
murder of Caesar begins in these words.
see on v. 27.

16. templa.. Virgil uses the plural in
the same way, Aen. 3. 84. The temple
of Vesta stood at the foot of the Pala-
tine near the south-west corner of the
Forum. ’

17. nimium, with ‘ querenti,’ ⁴ com-
plaining more than he could bear ι’ she
complains of the murder of her great
descendant. Horace connects the name
of Ilia (Rea Sylvia) with the Julian line as
virgil does those of Ilus and Iulus, Aen. r. ’
