LIBER. EPOD. 9,. 35]

EPODE IX.

‘Wnan shall we have our feast, Maecenas, to celebrate Caesar's victory as we
celebrated the defeat of Sextus Pompeius a little while ago? Oh, the shame to
think of Roman soldiers in Cleopatra’s effeminate camp Ι Even Galatian horsemen
deserted her, and her fleet would not fight. Why is not the triumphal procession
already moving—the triumph of a captain greater than Marius or the younger
Scipio? Our foe has changed his scarlet for mourning, and fled across the sea
with no harbour to go to. Bring wine, boy, and the largest cups; we may
sorget all our anxieties for Caesar’s welsare.’

Compare Od. 1. 37 Introd., Introd. to Books i-iii, § 1, and Introd. to the Epodes.
This Epode is manifestly written on the receipt of the news of the battle of
Actium, and before the subsequent fate of Cleopatra and Antony.was known,
when even the direction os their flight was a matter of conjecture, vv. ²9-32·

dour about him, an epithet to harmonize
with ‘ festas) ‘ alta‚’ etc., which express
Horace's anticipation of the banque't
which is to match the occasion‚-partly
in the news of this crowning victory of
his friend and his policy.

5. tibiis, lyra. The two instrument-s
are used even at Homer's banquets; Il.
18. 495 αὐλοὶ φόρμιγγές τε βοὴν ἔχον.
Cp. Od. 3. 19. 16-18. There isa doubt,
however, whether ‘mixtum’ must be
pressed to mean that they were used
at the same moment, as the next verse
would then imply not merely that the
two instruments but the two ‘modes’ or
⁴ scales,' ἡ Δωριστί and ἡ Φρυγιστί, could
be played together (see Dict. Ant. end
of Asticle on Greek Music). For the

plural ‘ tibiis‘ see on Od. 1. 1. 32.

6. inis, sc. ‘sonantibus,’ as though
the construction had been ‘sonantibus
mixtum carmen tibiis et lyral.

barbarum, used instead of ‘Phry-
gium' for the sake of the antithesis to
¹ Dorium.' The Phrygian mode and its
appropriate instrument belong rather to
orgies and revelry (Od. 3. 19. 16), the
Dorian to martial music. This occasion
walls for both.

7. nuper. Five years before, when
Sextus Pompeius (in Sept. ac. 36) was
totally defeated by Agn'ppa off N au-
lochus in Sicily, and driven from the sea
to take refuge in Asia.

Neptunius 3 he called himself the son
of Neptune and the sea, Appian 5. 100,
Dio C. 48. 19. In the same chapter
Dio speaks of the multitude of runaway
slaves who joined his fleet, cp. Epod.
