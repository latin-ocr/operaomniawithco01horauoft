show that the Danube is included. Hero-
dotus (2. 33) imagines it to be the exact
counterpart of the Nile, and the corres-
pondence was extended by others to this
special point. Sen. Quaest. Nat. 4. 1

The rivers stand sor
their respective countries—Egypt, Dacia,
Armenia (Epp. 1. 12. 26). The force of
the epithet ‘ qui celat,’ etc„ is to point
the distance to which Augustus' rule
extends. It spreads up rivers whose
source no traveller has explored.

47. beluosu83 3. 27. 26 ‘scatentem
The adjective is found
in no other good author. It seems to
owe its formation to the Greek pte‘ya-
κήτης, βαθυκήτηε, etc. ; ep. 1. 3. 18.

Britain was not in the reign of Augustus ’
in any sense reduced, but the princes of
different tribes had sent embassies to
him with presents and professions of
friendship; Strabo, 4. 5. 3.

rediturae parcere vitae! The variant
‘ paventes ’ is found in a few MSS. and
was read apparently by Porph. It is
preferred by Bentley, on the ground that
the variety ‘ Galliae (plur. nom. as in
Suet. Jul. 49 ‘ Gallias Caesar subegit‚'
and commonly) non paventes, duraeque
tellus Iberiae‚' is more Horatian than
two genitives dependent on ⁵ tellus.'
