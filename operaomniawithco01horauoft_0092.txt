50 HORATII CARMINUM

for the Ode in nc. 29, when Augustus, according to the statement both of
Suetonius (Oct. 28) and of Dio Cassius (52. 1), entertained the thought of aban-
doning the supreme power which had just fully come into his hands. Dio gives
a speech of Maecenas on that occasion, in which he uses the very allegory of the

Ode.

As Macleane remarks, this may prove too much. It is as certain as oen be

that Horace drew his image not from any speech of Maecenas, but from Alcaeus.
Maecenas or Dio may more probably have taken theirs from Horace.
The image of a ship for the State is an old one. See, inter alia, Aesch. Sept. c.

T. 1, Soph. O. T. 25, Plat. Resp. p. 488, Theognis, 671-682.

O NAVIS‚ referent in mare te novi
Fluctusx' O quid agis? Fortiter occupa
Portum! Nonne vides, ut
Nudum remigio latus
Et malus celeri saucius Africo ‘⁵
Antennaeque gemant, ac sine funibus
Vix durare carinae
Possint imperiosius
Aequor? Non tibi sunt integra lintea,
Non di, quos iterum pressa voces malo. 10

1. referent . . novi, a double state-
ment. Fresh waves are rising, and
they will carry thee back. Horace
speaks of the civil war under the same
metaphor in Od. 2. 7. 15 ‘ Te rursus in
bellum resorbens Unda fretis tulit aest-
uosis‚' and in Epp. 2. 2. 47‘ Civilis . .
belli . . aestus’; although in those cases
it is individuals, not the State, who are
battling with the waves.

2. fortiter occupa portum, ‘make
a brave effort and gain the harbour
first,' i.e. before the fresh waves prevent
you. The ship is still outside the bar.

4. nudum, supply ‘sit,’ as also after
‘saueius’ Orelli speaks of this as
‘miro zeugmate ex v. ‘⁶ gemant ’' v.
“sit” elicere,' and thinks it sar more
poetical to make ‘ gemant ' the verb to
all three clauses. But it is a harsher
zeugma to speak of a broadside swept
bare of rowers as ‘ groaning' in the same
sense as yardarms. And if ‘gemant’
, apply to au three subjects, the ‘an-
tennae' are left without any special

ἐ description of the injury done to them.
ζ Bentley, accepting the reading os some
’ of the less ancient MSS, ⁴ gemunt‚' ⁸ pos-

sunt‚' puts the question at ⁴ latus,' mak-
· ing the second stanza consist of cate—

gorical statements. For ⁶ vides ut . .
gemant,’ the particular sense of ‘seeing '
being lost after a time in the more
general notion of ‘ perceiving‚’ cp. Od.
3. xo. 5-8 ‘Audis quo strepitu ianua . .
remugiat Ventis, et positas ut glaciet
nives Iuppiter‚’ and Virg. Aen. 4. 490
‘ mugire videbis Sub pedibus terram et
descendere montibus ornos-¹

6. sine funibus. They are the ὕπο·
ζώματα of Plat. Resp. p. 616 (ἴς cp.
Acts 27. 17 βοηθείαις ἐχρῶντο brochv-
vvvre: τὸ πλοῖον, ropes passed round
the hull to prevent the timbers starting.

7. durare, Virg. Aen. 8. 577 ¹ durare
laborem.’

· carinae, apparently a plural for a

hull, tbe bottom. Bentley takes it as a

8. imperiosius,
‘ peremptory.' The sea insists on break-
