INTRODUCTION TO THE

CARMEN SECULARE

AMONG the antiquarian and religious revivals of Augustus, Suetonius
(Aug. 31) mentions the ‘Ludi Seculares’; Dio (54. 18) fixes the date
to the consulship of C. Furnius and C. Silanus, 13.c. 17, but beyond
ι this and the fact that it professed to be their fifth celebratio'm he tells
us nothing. No full account of them is found earlier than Censorinus

. (de Die Natali, c. 5 ‘-de Seculo'), the writer on astrology in the
,λ second half of the 3rd century, who* is supplemented by Zosimus

(2. 5), the historian‚ in the middle of the 5th century.
’ Tacitus (Ann. 11. 11) mentions their repetition in the reign of

’ Claudius, A. D. 46, but declines to describe them, on the ground that

he has already given in the Histories (in one of the Books now lost)
a particular account of their celebration under Domitian, on which
occasion he had had the fullest cognizance of their details, as being
himself one of the ⁴ quindecimviri ' and a praetor. ⁴
ffThe games of which they professed to be the revival went under

. the Republic by the name of Tarentini (or Te-rentini) and Taurii, the

former name being connected by all writers with the ‘ stagna Tarenti'

⁴ or ‘ Terenti‚' a spot at the north edge of the Campus Martius, near-

the river, once a swamp, and probably a warm spring (see Burn’s
Rome and the Campagna, p. 300), the locality of some of the cere-
monies even in Augustus’ celebration 3 the latter variously derived,—'
by Servius (on Virg. Aen. 2. 140), from the ‘taureae,' or sterile cows
which were sacrificed.

Their origin according to some of the authorities, according to

“ others their second celebrati0n‚ was ascribed to Val. Publicola. All
