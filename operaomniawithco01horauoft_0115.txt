Or the person whose death is the subject of this Ode we know nothing but what
is contained in the statement of the Chronicon of Eusebius (Am. 264—340), which,
opposite the year A.v.c. 750, B.c. 24, has (in the Latin version of Jerome) ⁶ Quin-

ἶ tilius Cremonensis Vergilii et Horatii familiaris moritur.’ We may notice that the
mention of Cremona makes him a neighbour of Virgil. The Scholiasts on Horace

call him Quintilius Varus, and add that he was a Roman knight, identifying him
with the Quintilius of A. P. 438, see on v. 8, and with Varus of Od. 1. 18.

The Ode is not merely, as Porph. describes it, ’θρῆνος in Quintilium sodalem Ver-
gilii.² The Pseudo-Aer. characterizes it more justly, ‘ Consolatur Vergilium impa-

” tienter amici sui mortem lugentem.’ Horace’s feeling is for Virgil as much as for

their common friend. From this point of view we must be struck by the delieacy

j of the ‘ consolation.’ He justifies Virgil's grief, he shares it. ‘ He too will join in
Χ the dirge; Quintilius is gone, the peerless, the soul of modesty, honour, justice, and

truth! All good men weep; and who has greater right to weep than Virgil,
whose piety and trustfulness the gods have so hardly rewarded’? Only at last,

ἶ when he has opened his friend's beart by his expression of sympathy‚ does he

. venture on a hint, not perhaps of comfort, but of sels-restraint. ‘After all, no
laments, though sweeter than Orpheus, no prayers, will reach the dead. It is a cruel
. fate, patience only will lighten what may not be cured.'

It would seem, is Donatus be giving a genuine trait of Virgil in his Life, c. 18,
that Horace is recalling his friend to his own philosophy for consolation: ‘ Solitus
