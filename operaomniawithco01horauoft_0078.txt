36 HORATII CARMINUM

Certus enim promisit Apollo,
Ambiguam tellure nova Salamina futuram.

O sortes peioraque passi 30
Mecum saepe viri, nunc vino pellite curas3

Cras ingens iterabimus aequor.

‘Auspex ⁷ is used elsewhere either of the
person who attends the imperator and
actually takes the auspices, or if? in the
sense of ⁸ patron‚’ then only of some
god who by omens or otherwise sanc-
tions an enterprise. Meanwhile a cer-
tain amount of doubt hangs over the
reading. Paris A, with a few other
MSS„ has ‘ auspice Teucri‚' and Acron’s
note looks as if he had found that read-
ing auspice. 'Fautore vel suasore, Apol-
linem dicit cuius responsa vel promissa
sequebatur.' Victorinus (fourth cen-
tury), who is quoted in desence of the
vulg„ gives no support to it. He only
quotes the line for its metre, and two
of the best MSS. of his work read
‘Teucri.⁸ Keller accepts that reading.
1t must then mean ‘ under the guidance
of Teucer and of Teucer's patron‚’ sc.
Ap0110; but ‘ auspex' in this sense with
a genitive of the person patronized is
unlikely, and the combination ‘ duce . .
auspice' is harsh. Bentley reads ex
conj. ‘ Phoeb0,’ which would satissy

Acron's note, though not so probably
as ‘Teucri.' The slight variation of
a technical phrase, which is the main
ground on which Bentley opposed the
vulg„ is really quite in Horace’s manner,
see on Od. 3. 5. 42.

name,' cp. the use of ἀμφίλεκτος, Aesch.
Ag. 1585. Lucan, 3. 183, in ‘memory

of this place, ‘veram Salamina.’ Cp. ’

Virgil's ‘ salsi Simoentis: ‘ simulata Per-
gama‚' Aen. 3. 302, 349.

30 peioraque passi, Virg. Aen. 1 . 199
⁸ O passi graviora dabit Deus his quo-
que finem“; both are from Hom. Od. 12.
208 ὦ φίλοι οὐ γάρ πώ τι κακῶν ἀδαὲ
ἡμονέε εἶμεν.

3²· iterabimus, ‘take again to the
boundless sea,’ which he had just
crossed from Troy. It gives much
more force to the dreariness of ‘ ingens'
than to suppose that they had lauded
for the night in their flight, see on v. ²3·
