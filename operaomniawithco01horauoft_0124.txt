82 HORATII CARMINUM

the shore near Tarentum. Which is most likely, that a speaker on the shore of ’
Apulia should commend a passing sailor to the care of ‘Neptune‚ the warder of
sacred Tarentum‚’ or that one speaking at Tarentum shall apostrophize Archytas
in his bun'al place on the ‘litus Matinum’? The question seems to be really “
settled by the second local reference in v. 26. The woods about Venusia are near
enough to stand for the ‘inland woods ’ on the shore just north of the Aufidus, but
they would not occur naturally if the scene were at Tarentum. “
sse Ode consists of at least two parts; some moralizing on the universality of
Death, connected in some way with the fate of Archytas, and the petition of an
unburied corpse for the handful of saud which would enable it to cross the Styx.
What is the relation between the two? The oldest answer was that the unburied
body was that of Archytas himself, who (we must suppose) had been drowned and
cast ashore during a voyage on the Adriatic. The Scholiasts consider the Ode a ’
monologue, the shade of Archytas addressing itself in the first twenty lines, and
, appealing to a passing sailor in the remainder. The commonet view makesjt a
dialogue begun by the sailor who finds the body of the philosopher, and moralizes
upon it till he is interrupted by the shade of Archytas. Where the'⁷break' takes
place is a question still to be settled. Verses 7, 15, 17, and 21, have all been pro-

ἒ posed. A chief motive for throwing the division as late at least as v. 15, is to

prevent the appeal of v. 14 ⁴ Iudice te non sordidus auctor Naturae verique' from
being addressed by Archytas to the sailor. Newman, on the contrary, hears in
the appeal so addressed a very keynote of the Ode. He thinks that ‘ the poem is
written in the spirit of Lucian to ridicule the mixture of old mythology and new*
philosophy in Southern Italy, where the Pythagorean doctrines were widely dif-
fused. The sailor is presumed, by the shade of Archytas, to be an adherent of
Pythagoras?

Dillenburger‚ dividing at v. 17, thinks that the point of the Ode is the mutual
exposure by a philosopher and a man of the world of the vanity of their respec-
tive pursuits‚—the philosopher measuring the sand and dreaming of metem-
psychosis, the trader so intent on his pursuit of gain as to be unwilling to spare’a
minute to render the last service to his brother man‚—both losing sight of death,
and of their common humanity. The chief difficulty in the way of thiffinterpre-
tation is supposed to lie in the rendering of vv. 2, 3. Can ⁸ parva munera pulveris
te cohibent’ mean ‘ the want of the gift of a little dust keeps you fast'? Or has
Horace, when he makes Archytas ask for burial in v. 23, forgotten that he had
already buried him in v. 2? Perhaps we may say tliat neither Horace nor
Archytas vouch for the fact of a due sprinkling of dust. Tbey are the sailor’s
words; and he is thinking at the time of the small compass to which the far-
reaching mind of the philosopher is shrunk‚ notos the sufficiency or insufficiency
of his burial. Archytas replies that his case is worse even than the sailorhnd
supposed, sor he still lacks the sand that would give his shade rest. ·‹

Those interpreters who, sor this or other reasons, hold that the unburied body is ⁷

of some other than Archytas, explain the address of the early lines by placing the “

scene of the Ode in sight of Archytas' tomb. There is still a question whether it ⁷
is a dialogue or a monologue. The interpretation which Orelli gives from an

anonymous friend, and which he favours hiinself, makes the oontrast between “

vv. 1—2o‚ which contain reflections on the common doom of mortality suggested
to a passing voyager by the sight of the philosopher's tomb, and the remainder of
the Ode, in which the voice of an unburied corpse on the shore is supposed to
interrupt his moralizing, and in its urgent appeal to suggest that, after all, death is
not the hardest of fates.

Ritter imagines the Ode to have been suggested by the drown3ng of some
