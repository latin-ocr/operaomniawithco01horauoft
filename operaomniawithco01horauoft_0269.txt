LIB. ΙΙΙ.

OD. 21. 227

O D E XXI.

er'rnn in anticipation of entertaining M. Valerius Messalla Corvinus. Dillr.

bids us compare with this Ode Epp. 1. 5.

‘Cask of Massic, as old as myself, your potent contents were kept for some

happy occasion, and they shall be broached to-day for Corvinus.

He, philosopher

as he is, will not despise you. Old Cato, they tell us, did not object to a cup of
wine. You make genius flow ; you give fresh hope to the anxious and courage to
the poor. With your help, and Liber and Venus and the Graces‚ we will keep the

banquet up till daylight!

Corvinus (the ‘Messalla’ of Sat. 1. 6. 42, 1. 10. 85, A. P. 371 ‘diserti Mes· ‚
sallae' ) was, like Pollio, at once distinguished in the political and the literary
world. He had belonged to the senatorian party, and turned Octavius’ flank m
the first day's fighting at Philippi. He subsequently joined Octavius against
Antony, and commanded the centre of his fleet at Actium. After the settlement
he retired from active life, and devoted himself to oratory and literature. He was

the great friend and patron of Tibullus.

With the fourth and fifth stanzas should be compared Ovid’ 5 imitation, A. A. 1.

‘Vina parant animos faciuntque caloribus apt0s3
Cura fugit, multo diluiturque mero.

Tunc veniunt risus, tunc pauper cornua sumit3
Tunc. dolor et curae rugaque frontis abit:

Tunc ,aperit mentes aevo rarissima nostro
Simplicitas, artes excutiente deo‘3

and the fragment of Maecenas' ‘ symposium: which Ritter quotes from Servius on

the words ‘ faciles oculos ' in Virg. Aen. 8. 310: ⁴ Hoc . .

etiam Maecenas in Sym-

posio cui Vergilius et Horatius interfuerunt, eum ex persona Messallae de vino
loqueretur, ait: idem humor ministrat faciles oculos, pulchriora reddit omnia, et dulcis

iuventae reducit bona?

1. Epod. 13. 6 ‘Tu vina Torquato
move Consule pressa meo? The date
implies that Corvinus is promised not
merely old wine (it was of the vintage
of B..c 65, when L. Manlius Torquatus
and L. Aurelius Cotta were coss, and
herefore must have been at least 35
years old), but also wine which carried

, with it personal reminiscences of the

poet’s own life, and which therefore it
is a proof of friendship to offer. Cp.
the dating of the Sabine wine which* 1s
offered to Maecenas· 1n 1. 20.

2-5. The point of imagining these
possible effects of the wine on different

tempers, seems to lie in the expression
of its potency‚ ‘it must have some great
effect, whatever th'at be', · and the stress
is really laid rather on the last of each
pair ofy alternatives‘ seu. .sive‚’ ‘seu.
seu) This· 15 shown by the insertion of
‘pia testa' in a place where it 15 intended

to exert its influence on the whole stanza,
and by the repetition, after that‘ quo-

question of the tendency of the wine, of
