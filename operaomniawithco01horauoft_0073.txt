LIB Ι. OD. 6. 31 v

ODE VI.

ι ‘HERmc exploits require a Homer to sing of thern‚' says Horace, and so gives
. Agrippa the lyric glory that (it would seem) he has asked for, while professing to

”” leave the task of celebrating such exploits' to the epic genius of Varius. For

panegyric cast in the same form compare Od. 2. 12 and 4. 2. Α
The Ode is addressed to M. Vipsanius Agrippa, the friend and counsellor of

⁷ - Augustus, and the greatest commander of his reign. He finally defeated Sextus

Pompeius at Naulochus in B.c. 36, and commanded at Actium in B.c. 31. After
the death of Marcellus (and consequently, it would seem, after the publication of
this Ode) he was married by Augustus to his daughter Julia (nc, 21); was asso-
ciated with him (mc. 18) in the Tribunitian power, and was looked upon as his
intended successor. He died four years before Horace, in B.c. 12. Horace speaks
of his popularity in Sat. 2. 3. 185 ; of his subjugation of the Cantabri in Epp. 1. 12.
263 of his engineering exploit of turning the Lucrine lake into a harbour, though
without mentioning his name, in A. Ρ. 63.

(see Od. 2.1. 12, 16. 2. 7. 15, 3. 5. 5). The
nite promise or prophecy,—although

position of the words is quite in his man-

Varius is said really to have written a
‘Panegyricus in Caesarem Octavianum '
(see Epp. 1. 16. 27, where Horace is said
by the Schol. to have borrowed ²2¹5 lines
from that poem) which would have
contained the exploits of Agrippa,-but
=‘ scribaris licet,’ ‘ I shall leave Varius
to write of you! Cp. Od. 1. 7. 1 ‘ lauda-
bunt alii'; 1. 20. 10 ‘bibes’; 3. 28. 13

description, cp. v. 14. Sat. 2. 1. 16..

nd the Comm. Cruq. found it, for the
difficulty of the ablative made them
separate it from ⁶ Vario ¹ and explain it

ξ by ‘Homericis auspiciis.’ Ritter takes

‘ Vario ¹ as a dative, and ‘alite' as a loose

 

,⁴ *ad sensum ’ apposition to it. It seems

» ‚better with Orelli to take ‘Vario . . alite'

as an abl.> absolls'a' construction? the use

,. J 'ffibfvlffich Horace is ineuned to extend

ner; the promise or permission standing
first, and accompanied only by Varius'
name as a sufficient guarantee to stay in
initio any impatience; then, measured
off against each other, the characteristics
of the theme and of the poet who is fit
to-sing of it. ‘ It shall be told⁷ but by
Varius, thy bravery* and thy victories,
for he is a bird of Maeonian song.’
For the grammatical difficulty of the
separation of ‘Vario' frorn ‘alite' we
may perhaps compare Sat. 1. 3. 70 ⁴ Cum
mea compenset vitiis bona‚’ if ‘cum’
be there a preposition. For more certain
but rather less analogous cases of odd
sorting of words see Sat. 2. 1. 60; 2. 3.
2. 11. The passages usually quoted on
this place, such as <of Horace) Sat. 2. 1.
84 ‘ Iud'rce laudatus Caesare ’; Epp. 1. 1.
94 ‘curatus inaequali tonsore‚' are in-
sufficient to substantiate the use of the
ablative of the agent without a preposi-
tion. There is either a predicate pre-
sent, as in ‘iudice Caesare ’ (Dillenburger
quotes it as ‘laudatus Caesare,' which
would be just the case we are in search
of), which brings it within the scope of
the abl. absol„ or else the subst. is
barely personal‚ and the abl. becomes
rather instrumental or modal, as in Ov.
