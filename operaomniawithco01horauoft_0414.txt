Cales venenis officina Colchicis. ⁷ 35 ’ „

HORATII EPQDON

Quae finis aut quod me ma'net stipendium?
Effare3 iussas cum fide poenas luam,

Paratus expiare, seu poposceris

Centum iuvencos, sive mendaci lyra

Voles sonari: Tu pudica, tu proba 4ο
Perambulabis astra sidus aureum.

Infamis Helenae Castor offensus vice

F ratesque magni Castoris, victi prece,

Adempta vati reddidere lumina.

Et tu, potes nam, solve me dementia, , 45
O nec paternis obsoleta sordibus,

Neque in sepulcris pauperum prudens anus
Novendiales dissipare pulveres.

Ant. 960, possibly, as Bentley suggested,
with a reminiscence of Lucretius’ ‘ flam-
mai flore,’ 1. 898. Orelli takes it of
the green, sulphurous flame of a vol-
cano; but it does not appear that the
fire os Aetna has any colour which
would justify such· an epithet‚ or that
the ancients attributed any such colour
to it. There is a variety of reading
among the later MSS, the ἰ in ‘ virens’
being scratched by alater hand in three,
‘ urens’ being found in several, ‘ furens,'
which Bentley preferred, in a few.

35. ealeS. The boldness of the me-
taphor attracted the notice of Porph.:
‘ipsam mulierem officinam venenorum
diserte dixit.· Canidia is a laboratory
of magic drugs. in which the fires will
not slacken till Horace is bumt to ashes,
which the wind can carry about and
make sport os.

36. stipendium, ‘ composition,' ‘ pay-
ment in lieu of punishment.’ ‘When
will the end come, or how can Ι buy
myself off’? Cp. Catull. 64. 173, of
the human tribute exacted by the Mino-
taur, ·dira ferens stipendia tauro.’ It is
not uncommonly used of a tribute
imposed on a conquered country; ‘sti-
pendio multare‚’ Cic. pro Balb.. 18.

39. mendaci lyra, parallel to v. 20.

He must lie to praise her, 'but he will ’

other meaning of the words would have
been the more obvious of the two. The

humour consists, not in any by—play
which Canidia is supposed to miss. but
in the offering as a palinode a lampoon
more bitter than that which it professes J
to retract.

Dillr. follow Bentley in preferring

two MSS. of no great age; the con·
struction, then, as in Plaut. Rud. 3. 5.
34 ‘ Yos respondetote istinc istarum
vicem.

46. obsoletum cp. (with Orelli) ‘Virtus
. . neque alienis sordibus obsolescit:
Cic. pro Sest. 28; ‘ of tattered reputation
from the meanness of your parentage.'
Horace uses it elsewhere of a tumble·
down house; Od. 2. 10. 6.

47. prudens, ‘well skilled: It is per-
haps with special reference to the em·
phatic ‘pauperum' as the Scholiast
suggests; she shows her wisdom in ι
choosing graves that were not guarded.

48. novendiales, ⁶ ninth-day ashes '
seem to mean ‘fresh buried.’ These
were held fitter for a wizard's purpose-3

‘ novendialis) properly means ⁸ continu-
ing for nine days ; and this is the com- ·
mon meaning of ‘novendiale sacrum:
‘novendiales feriae‚' etc. But it seems
also to have been used of the special
ceremonies which, at Rome as well ns
in Greece, took plaoe on tlte uincla day
