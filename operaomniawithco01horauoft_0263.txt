A unm to Faunus: cp. 1. 17. 1-8. Horace prays that the visits of the god to
his lands may be kindly, and promises that the due kid and wine and incense shall
be offered at the Faunalia on the nones of December, the holiday of cattle and of
¹villagers, the day of peace, when even the wolf strays harmlessly among the lambs;
when the trees shed their leaves to strew Faunus’ path, and the ditcher revenges
himself on the ground which has worked him so hard, by dancing on it:

Lenis incedas abeasque parvis
