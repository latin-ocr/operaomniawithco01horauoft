53. gens. ‘These armies that we have
been provoking are to us as wolves to
deer. Remember the story and character
of the Roman people generally.’ The
stanza is a re'sume' of the story of the Aen-
eid. Cp. especially Aen. 1. 1—7‚ 67, 68.

cremato fortis ab Ilio. Grammatic-
ally ‘ab Ilio' answers to ‘ad urbes
Ausonias‚’ and‘ fortis' qualifies‘ per·
· tulit'; but the collocation which pairs

‘fortis’ with ‘sscremato and makes‘ ab
Ilio' follow closely and apparently
depend on ‘fortis' (⁶ stepping forth in
strength from the ashes of Ilium' ), is
meant to suggest the idea of the next
stanza, that their very calamities only
Ξέθῖἂίωᾶἰὲεῗὲἓέἑξὲΐέὲῗοέἶὲ ξξῗέ
Vv, 53, 54 contrast the perils of fire ahd
of water. “

54. iactata, probably agreeing with
‘gens‚' ‘ior zill their tossing on the
Tuscan sea! ‘ Multum ille et terris iac·
tatus et alto,’ Virg. Aen. 1. 3.

sacrm Virg. Aen. 1. 68, 2. 293

56. pertulit, os perseverance through
difficulty, and of success.

· on 1. 35. 19, 2. 2. 1, 4. 2. 7), the inter-
pretation cannot shake itself clear of
the langu ag e of the alle g.ory eFor
every bough it loses, for every cut the

spirit.‘ ⁶ Opes ’ and ‘ animus‚’ or ‘animi‚’

were joined in this way almost proverbi-
ally‚Virg. Aen. 2. 799, Caes. B. G. 7. 76. A
few MSS. read ‘animos’ here, but Horace
seems purposely to vary the termination.

61. The stanza has been pronounced
an interpolation by Meineke and other
(britios, on the ground of its introduc-
tion of mythological lore, which seemed
to them frig1 d, and such as we find
rather 1n Propertius and 1n the Alexan-
drine poets. Horace possibly had in
mind the saying of Pyrrhus recorded by
Florus, 1. 18⁵ Video me (inquit) plane
Herculis sidere procreatum, cui quasi ab
angue Lernaeo tot caesa hostium capita

e san uine suo renasean ur.'

firncigior. The adjective is more ap·
propriate to the resolution of the Roman
people. and the firm front of their legions,
than to the hydra ; but, in reference to
it, it would seem to be antithetical to
‘ secto corpore,‘ and to mean “sounder ’ ;
when he slashed its body it laced him
in a moment entire as before.

62. vinci dolentem, ‘ chafing at the
soil: Conington. It is the measure of
the unexpected persistence of the foe.

63. monstrum, of the armed warriors
that sprang from the dragon’s teeth,
sown by Jason in the furrows which
the fire-breathing bulls had ploughed
(Ov. Met. 7. 121 foll.)‚ or by Cadmus
at Thebes (Ov. Met. 3. 24 foll.) So new
soldiers seem to spring from the earth
for Rome.
