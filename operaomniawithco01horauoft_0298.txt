‘virgo' is doubtless a vestal, the sin-
gular number probably having reference
to the ‘ Virgo Maxima? The special
ceremony referred to is thought to be
one which took place on the Ides of
March, when prayers were offered in the
temple of Jupiter Capitolinus for the
salubrity of the coming year, and other
rites were performed under the super·
intendence of the Pontifex Maximus
and the Virgo Maxima, or chief of the
Vestals. The fact rests mainly on ‘a
statement in the fragment ‘De Mensi-
bus‚' of Jo. Lydus (a Byzantine writer
of the 6th century, quoted by Preller,
Romische Mythologie‚ p. 320).

10 foll. It is a question whether
⁶ qua violens,’ etc.‚ qualifies ‘dicar'
(6 many shall say of me on the banks of
my native Aufidus, that I was the first‚'
etc.) or ‘ princeps deduxisse' (⁴ I shall be .
spoken of as one who by the banks of
Aufidus was the first to,' etc.) The last
is the more likely. Horace wishes his
birthplace to be remembered in his own
same, ‘longe sonantem natus ad Aufi-
dum? 4. . 2 ; but he is claiming world-
wide fam , not merely to be remembered
in his birthplace. There is a further
question as to the construction of ‘ex
humili potens.' Most editors have
taken it of Horace himself, ‘ raised from

humility to glory,’ comparing Epp. 1.

20. 20 ‘Me libertino—natum patre et in
tenui re Maiores pennas nido extend-
isse? Bentley prefers to refer the words
to Daunus, as describing his rise. The
story made him an Illyrian exile, who
became King of Apulia. If it be taken
so. Horace must still be thinking of him-
self, and seeing a likeness of his own
fortunes in those of Daunus.

10. violens obstrepit, ‘longe sonans‚'
¹ acer‚‘ Sat. 1. 1. 58. Cp. Od. 4. 14. 25.
The Aufidus is within ten miles of Ve-
nusia, and Horace must have seen it in s
flood. ‘ Like most of the rivers of
Italy, it has much of the character of a
mountain torrent,’ Dict. Geog. For
the absol. use of ‘ obstrepit’ cp. Epod.
2. 27.

13. Aeolium carmen, etc.. ⁸ to have
made the lyric poetry of Aeolia at home
among Italian measures.‘ The use of
‘ deducere ' seems akin to that of ⁶ dedu-
cere coloniam.’
