⁵*EPODE nr

A MocK heroic invective against garlic, Horace has caten some dish seasoned
with it at Maecenas’ table, and he treats it as a practical joke of his host’s (v. 20
‘iocose Maecenas’). ‘ Garlic should be substituted for hemlock in the punishment
of parricides. What can the reapers' stomachs be made of? He has taken poison—
viper's blood, some decoction of Canidia's—the very drug which Medea used to
prevent the bulls touching Jason, and to destroy Creiisa. The heat of Apulia in
the dog-days, of Hercules’ fiery garment, was nothing to it. If Maecenas has the

bad taste to have such a dish again, may he be rewarded by finding that he cannot
get a kiss if he wishes it.'

Compare the commencement os Od. 2. 13.

PARENTIS olim si quis impia manu
Senile guttur fregerit,
Edit cicutis allium nocentius.
O dura messorum ilia!
Quid hoc veneni saevit in praecordiis? 5
Num viperinus his cruor
Incoctus herbis me fefellit? an malas>
Canidia tractavit dapes?
Ut Argonautas praeter omnes candidum
Medea mirata est ducem, 10
Ignota tauris illigaturum iuga
Perunxit hoc Iasonem3

1. olim. The development, accord-

ing to the context, from an original
meaning ⁶ at that time‚’ i. e. ‘ not at this
time‚' of the definite meanings ‘ at a past
time ' (as Od. 3. 11. 5 ⁴ nec loquax
olim ’) and ‘ at a future time ’ (as Od. 2.
10. 17 ‘non si male nunc et olim Sic
erit'), as well as the colourless meaning
a any time,' ‘ ever’ (as in this place;
cp. Sat. 1. 1. 25 ⁴ ut pueris olim dant
crustula blandi Doctores.’ Epp. 1. 10.
42,'etc.)‚ affor-ds a good illustration of
the general history of particles the most
definite in their eventual meaning, such
as ‘ dum,’ ‘ nam‚' and even the negatives;
it also illustrates the various uses of the
Greek aorist.

junctive; Sat. 2. 8. ρο.
