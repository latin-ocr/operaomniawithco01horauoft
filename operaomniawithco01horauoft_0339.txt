'Paullum sepultae distat inertiae
Celata virtus. Non ego te meis 30

Impune, Lolli, 'carpere lividas

preceding stamas, and applies it to the
special case of Lollius. ⁴ The pre-
Homeric heroes are dead and sorgotten,
and, being forgotten, what difference
does it make whether they were heroes

’ or cowards'? We will not allow such a

In the
words paullum sepultae, etc.‚ both the
participles really belong equally to both
substantives. ‘If you hide thern (i. e.
do not give them same through poetry),
valour differs little from cowardice, so
soon as they are both in the grave?
The appropriation of a participle to
each substantive is only a poetical arti-
fice to obtain point and preciseness in
soundn We gain from it the additional
suggestion of the equivalenee of the two
conditionS. ‘All colours are alike in
the dark’; ‘buried in oblivion‚ buried
in the grave, there is little difference in
the conditions, even if the things in

cowardice.' ‘On Horace's practice of
dividing between two subjects qualities

both, see on 2. 10. 6, 2. 11. 1, 2. 15. 18,
20, 3. 4. 18, Epod. 5. 37. Bentley,
missing this explanation, finds great
difficulty in the text, complaining that
⁴ sepultae ' is superfluous„ ‘ “ Forgotten
virtue differs little from baseness,” but if
you substitute “buried baseness‚” the
point os the comparison is gone.’ He
ingeniously proposed to remedy it. by
reading ‘inertia,’ ablative, ‘Virtue, if
concealed by [the poet's] remissness, is
as though it were buried.’

carpere is not inappropriate‚ as de-
scribing the action of ‘ obliviones,’ ‘ wear-
ing away‚’ ‘obliterating feature aster

recall the ⁸ tooth ’ of envy. Od. 4. 3. 16,

following verse seem to imply ‘the
qualities of a commanderss' and to have
special though delicate reference to
Lollius' military disaster. ‘ Foresight,

balance either by success or temporary
failure.'
