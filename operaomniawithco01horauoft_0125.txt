LIB. 1. OD. 28. Ἴ 83

¹ doctus iuvenis' which was the talk of Tarentum on some occasion when Horace
was staying there. He has been drowned on the Illyrian shore (v. 22), but his

’ . shade revisits Tarentum, apostrophizes Archytas, whose tomb is placed there, and

appearing to a sailor, bids him stop on his voyage to throw dust on its unburied
corpse, as he hopes for a prosperous return to more western waters (v. 26).

Others have supposed that the imaginary corpse is Horace's own. He had
been nearly lost at sea once off Cape Palinurus (od. 3. 4. 28). The scenery of
this Ode will hardly suit that occasi0n; but the event may have filled his mind
with thoughts and images of shipwreck.

In my notes I have inclined to Dillenburger’s interpretation, not as a completely
satisfactory one, but as less far-fetched than most, and involving fewer difficulties,
and as giving the Ode a thoroughly Horatian tone. That Archytas had a tomb

-” on the sea-coast, near Mount Garganus, is not a fact of history, nor in any way less Ι

an assumption of the interpreter than that he was drowned and cast ashore there.
We may notice that Horace seems to have been interested in the Pythagorean

² - doctrines, and especially in that of Metempsychosis, and yet not disinclined to

speak playfully of them, Epod. 15. 21, Epp. 2. 1. 52, S. 2. 6. 62. He ranks
Pythagoras with Socrates and Plato as representing the great teachers of Greek
philosophy, S. 2. 4. 3.

Archytas was a Greek of Tarentum, and lived in the fourth century ac. Like
the rest of the Pythagorean school of philosophers he was a great mathematician.

1. maris et terrae. Horace com-
bines the title of γεωμέτρης with the

2 charge of counting the sand which ex-

ceeds number. He is thinking probably

· of the ψαμμίτηε οῐλΑτοὴίῐιιεᾱεε, the r&

sponsibility of which he throws on

> Archytas as a kindred genius. The
¹ question with Archimedes was not

really the number of the sand, but

> the possibility of expressing numbers

which defied the capacity of the clumsy

’ Greek notation; though his treatise
- statis as an answer to those who had
“ asserted that the number of the sand on
- the shores of Sicily was infinite, or at

least incapable of arithmetical expres-
3 sion. ‘To count the sand ’ was a pro-
·, verb for wasted trouble, Pind. Ol. 13.
, 66, Virg. G. ². 104, so that the speaker
‘— is intended (as the oxymoron ‘mensorem

⁹ = . . numero carentis’ suggests) to put

· Archytas' labours.in a somewhat ridicu-
’, leus light.

ζ z. cohibent, ‘ confine,‘ κατέχει. The
ἵ eontrast is, of course, between the in-

finity of space and number through
which Archytas ranged in life, and
the tiny handful of dust which has
set bounds to him and his thoughts
now.

3. litus. There is a variant ‘latum’ ,⁵
found in B γ τ, and in the first hand,
altered subsequently to ‘litus‚' in A. '
Keller accepts it, and perhaps it is more χ
consistent than ‘litus withthe form of
the notes of Aer. and Porph. The
Scholiast on -γ read it, for his interpreta-
tion is ‘ amplum!

4. munera, specially used of the last
offices. It does not occur to the sailor
that the sand on Archytas’ body, if
there be sand, has been heaped by the
wind, not by human hand, and that the
tribute of a few grains duly thrown is
the one boon he still needs.

5. tentasse, as if there were some
audacity in lifting even the mind to the
heavenly bodies; ‘animo’ of course in
sense qualifies it as well as ‘per-
currlsse.
