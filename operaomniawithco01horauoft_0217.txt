that the mention of death, even under
the form of a promise of immortality‚
would not be a pleasing com liment.
The stress is laid on the dei cation;
death, as a necessary preliminary, is lost
to sight. ‘ Bibit: however, which
makes Augustus a ‘praesens deus‚' al-
ready living on earth the lise of a god,
is more in accordance with Horace's
usual language ; see especially Od. 4. 5.
31-36‚ and the passage already quoted
from Epp. 2. 1. 15 foll. ⁴ Praesenti tibi
maturos largimur honores Iurandasque
tuum per nomen ponimus aras.' It is
more likely also to have been altered,
as the more extravagant, especially to
ears familiar with the Christian concep-
tion of life aster death. But Horace's
own transfiguration in Od. 2. 20, and
the beatification given by the Muse to
Romulus and Hercules and the Dioscuri
in 4. 8 are metaphors of fame, not
forms of a future lise.

14. vexere, evidently, from the con- '

Compare Propertius’ account (3. 17. 8)
of the apotheosis of Ariadne, ⁴ Lyncibus
in caelum vecta Ariadna tuis. The
tamed tigers are not only an ornamental

. appendage, they are emblems of the

civrlizing labours‚ his ‘just purpose
firmly kept,’ whereby he merited deifi-
cation. These are recognized also pro-
bably in the ‘ pater‚’ although this was
a common address to the Roman gods.
Cp. Od. 1. 18. 6, Epod. 2. 22, Epp. 1.

translation see Ovid‚ Fast. 2. 481 foll.

ting in council on the question whether
Romulus shall be admitted to their
number. Juno, to the pleasure of all,
assents.
