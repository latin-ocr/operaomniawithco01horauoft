48 HORATII CARM IN UM

Fervens difficili bile tumet iecur.
Turn nec mens mihi nec color 5
Certa sede manent, humor et in genas
Furtim labitur, arguens
Quam lentis penitus macerer ignibus.
Uror, seu tibi candidos
Turparunt humeros immodicae mero η’)
Rixae‚ sive puerrfurens ⁴
Impressit memorem dente labris notam.
Non, si me satis audias,
Speres perpetuum, dulcia barbare
Laedentem oscula, quae Venus 15
Quinta parte sui nectaris imbuit.
Felices ter et amplius,
Quos irrupta tenet copula nec malis
Divolsus querimoniis
Suprema citius solvet amor die. 20

4. difficili, χαλεπῷ; ἀργαλέος χόλος,
Hom. 11. 18. 119, ‘ difficult to treat.’

iecur, the seat of passion with the
ancients; so ‘ bilis!

5. nec mens neo color. Almost a
zeugma, like Virgil’s ‘ inceptoque et
sedibus haeret in isdem? Aen. 2. 654;
the use of the same verb of a mental
and a physical fact, ⁴ my mind reels and
my colour comes and goes?

8. quam lentis, slow, and so tor-
turing.

14. perpetuum, ‘ constant!

1 5. oscula = ‘labella‚' ‘the pretty lips,’
Virg. Aen. 1. 256⁷ ‘ Oscula libavit natael

16. quinta parte. Ibycus. according
to Athenaeus, 2. p. 39 B, called honey
ἔννατον μέροε τῆς ἀμβροσίας. And the
Scholiast‚ on Pind. Pyth. 9. 116, says
that honey had been said to be δέκατον
μέρος τῆς ἀθανασίας. It is possible that
Horace may have had some such words
in his head in giving this numerical
ratio of the sweetness of Lydia's lips.
Another suggestion, to which Orelli in-

clines, is that he is thinking of Pytha-
goras’ division of the elements, earth.
air, fire, water, and ether, the πέμπτον
ὄν, πέμπτη οὐσία, ‘ quinta essentia‚’ the
most perfect element3 so that ‘quinta
pars’ will mean the ⁴ purest and best·
of her nectar. ⁴ Quintessence,' with
other words of the Pythagorean philo-

sophy, was affected by the Alchemists‚ ’ ἶ

and has passed from them into modern
language; but is we use it in⁸ trans-
lating Horace we must keep it free

from any unconseious associations of

their chemica} processes. It is the
‘best part,’ not what a modern per—
fumet would eall the ‘essence.’

20. suprema eitius die, ⁸ sooner
than at death? We may say that
‘ citius' is used for ‘ citius quam,' as
‘amplius' and ‘plus-»33 ‘n ue enim
plus septima ducitur aestas,‘
207; or that the ablative does double
duty, as the ablative of comparisonand

of the point of time. Cp. Od. 4. 14. 13 ξ’

‘ plus vice simplici!
