HORATII CARMINUM

alone in reading. apparently from a
gloss. ‘flexusl The Comm. Cruq. him-
self had read ‘victusss and interprets it
by ‘ flexus.’

22. annuissem Virg. Aen. 1. 257
‘ Parce metu, Cytherea ; manent immota
tuorum Fata tibi: cernes urbem et pro-
missa Lavini Moenia? ’

23. rebus Aeneae, the fortunes of
Aeneas and his house, as ‘res Asiae‚'

ductos, either ‘ carried along,' ‘ built:
or only ⁴ traced.’ See Conington on
Virg. Aen. ι. 42 3 ‘ pars ducere mu-
ros.’

25. argutae, Ju7e1as,predicative. She
learnt her clear singing, as well as her
harp·playing, of Apollo. Some MSS. of
inferior value have ‘Argivae,' which was
intended to be antithetical to ‘ Dauniae’
=‘ Latinae’3 see note on v. 28.

26. Xantho. The Lycian‚ not the
Trojan, Xanthus ; 3. 4. 62. Virg. Aen. 4.
143 ‘ hibernam Lyciam Xanthique fluenta
Deserit.' For the practice of introducing
into prayers the names of the sacred
haunts of the god addressed cp. 1. 30. 1,
3. 26. 10. Apollo’s long hair is at
once the sign of his perpetual youth (as
in v. 28 ‘levis‚’ i.e. ‘imberbis’) and part
of the costume of the bard; see Virg.
Aen. 1. 740 ⁴ crinitus Iopas.'

27. Dauniae, in the first plaoe, doubt-
less, Horace's own Muse (cp. 3. 30. 10,
and ‘ Calabrae Pierides ' of Ennius, 4. 8.
23), as is shown by the immediate trans-
ition to himself, ¹ spiritum Phoebus
mihi: etc. But it is not a purely local
designation. Horace would not have
said here ⁸ Venusinae Camenae.’ He

speaks of ‘Daunian blood’ ior Roman

or Italian in od. 2⁷1. 34„ and uses the
Apulian as the typica] representative of
all Roman virtues (od. 3. 5. 9. 3. 16. 26,
Epod. 2. 42); and so here the ‘ Daunian
Muse ¹ is the ‘ Italian Muse‚’ though he
would remember the special appropriate-
ness of the looel name, when the chosen
representative of Roman poetry is ε’.
Daunian born.

28. Agyieu. Ἀγυιεύς was a Greek '¹

name oflApollo as guardian os streets‚
ἀγυιαί, Aesch. Agam. 1081, Aristss vesp.
875. Ritter explains the choice of the
title by the fact that the Carmen Secu·
lare would be sung ‘sub dio.¹ This
seems far-setched, The associations of
the name were to Horace. probably,

to make it clear that it is the Greek god
in all his attributes whom he chims as
the protectores his Daunian Muse (the
antithesis ist'praeent, though we need not
in v. 25 rea ‘Argivae.' to make it too
obtrusive); and to this end the tho·
roughly Greek name contributas. Cp.
the force of a Greek form 1. 1. 34. The
unusual name makes t havoc among
the copyists. The Old Bland. hasoddly

has prayed to Phoebus, the Greek god
of poetry, to defend stom disgraee,
through failure of the poet or performers
or audience, the honour of the Italian
Muse. ‘Yes‚ it is Phoebus that· in-
