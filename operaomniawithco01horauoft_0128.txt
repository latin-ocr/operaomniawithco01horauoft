86 HORATII CARMINUM

Plectantur silvae te sospite, multaque merces,
Unde potest, tibi defluat aequo

Ab Iove Neptunoque sacri custode Tarenti.
Negligis immeritis nocituram ³0

Postmodo te natis fraudem committere? Fors et
Debita iura vicesque superbae

Te maneant ipsum: precibus non linquar inultis,

Italy, he would more probably be sail-
ing to the east than, like the ‘ mercator’

side the Straits.

27. plectantur, in its usual sense
not only of being lashed, but of bear-
ing the punishment3 ‘may all his ven-
geance be wreaked on them!

multa merces, ‘ a rich reward,' i. e.
for your humanity.

28. unde potest, 1 cannot reward
you, but there is that which will, the
favour of Jove, who (as originally in
his function os ξένιος) presides especially
over the reciprocal duties of men to one
another, and of Neptune the tutelary god
of Tarentum, who will remember kind-
ness shown to a citizen of his own. For
‘ unde' of a person, see on Od. 1. 12. 17.

being the ablatwe, as 1n ‘ nate Dea‚’
⁸ Apolline natus,’ etc: the opposition is
to ‘te ipsum? ‘Te’ has also been ξ

‘committere’ ‘ Is it nothing to thee {
that thou art committing‚’etc. ‘Negligis Ξ
committere' and. ‘negligis te commit·
tere ' are both possible constructions.

33. non linquar, i. e. ‘a te! If
thou leavest me my prayers for ven-
goe-nce will not be unhoerd. ·

36. ter, the sacred and complete
number; cp. Soph. of Antigone pom-ing
the dust on Polynice’s body, χοαῖσι
τρισπόνδοισι τὸν νέκυν στέφει, Ant. 430. ’
