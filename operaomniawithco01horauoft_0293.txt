LIB. III.

OD. 29.

Cum flore, Maecenas, rosarum et
, Pressa tuis balanus capillis

· Iamdudum apud me est.

Eripe te morae ; 5

Nec sem er udum Tibur et Aefulae
Declive contempleris arvum et
Telegoni iuga parricidae.
Fastidiosam desere copiam et ἡ
Molem propinquam nubibus arduis3 10
Omitte mirari beatae
Fumum et opes strepitumque Romae.

Δ4. tuis, ‘ expressly for you ’ ε in the

’ same way ‘ non ante verso lene merum

cado,’ wine which has not been opened,
but lest year after year to grow mellow,
is paired with ⁶ tibi’: it was kept for
you, and is good enough for you.

balanus ε· myrobalanus,' Plin. N. H.
12. 46, the Arabian ‘ behen nut,' giving
a fragrant oil.

5. iamdudum, antithetical to ‘ morae,'
as ‘me ’ to ‘ te.’ My part is done long
ago 3 vthe delay is on your side.

6. nee. The good MSS. are nearly
divided between ‘ nec ⁹ and ‘ ne‚' with an
odd variant ‘non.’ If we have ‘ ne' it
is fina1—‘ that you be not for ever look-
ing etc'. ⁶ Nec' is quite Horatian ; cp.
1. 9. 15, 1. 11. 2, 2. 11. 4, 3. 7. 29.
Difficulties have been felt about the
present subj. ‘ contempleris’ as contra-
vening the rule laid down by Madvig
(ξ 386; cp, his Opuscula, vol. 2. p. 104)

finite person the perfect subj. is used.
He allows an exception in Sat. 2. 3. 88

ne sis patruus mihi: and he might
have added Od. 2. 11. 4, ⁶ nec trepides.’
Aslight further anomaly is perhaps found
in the close conjunction of imperative
and subjunctive ‘ eripe’ ‘ contempleris’:
but there is a corresponding shade of
,difference in tone, the command drops a
little towards advice or entreaty; cp.
the changes of mood in 1. 11, also ad-
dressed to a definite person, ‘ne quae-
sieris‚' ⁸ sapias‚' ‘ carpe! A question has
been raised whether ‘ semper’ should be
taken with ⁴ contempleris‚’ ⁸ be not for
ever content to see the fair country view
from your windows '3 or (as Ritter pre-
fers) with ¹ udum,' ‘Tibur never dry,’
the ⁴ uda mobilibus pomaria n'vis ' of 1.
7. 13, ¹ contempleris ' having in this case
a somewhat stronger force thrown on

it ¹: ⁴ Don’t stay to gaze at it, come to
it.’ The first is the simpler. The places
named are all such as we view from
Rome. Missing this obvious sense, Lach-
mann altered ‘nec ’ to ⁴ hic: and others
have suggested ‘ ut'; but did theysssup-
pose that Horace had residences at all
these places, or that they were visible
from his sarm in the Sabine hills, or that
he was inviting Maecenas to a tour about
Latium? ¹

Aefulae, evidently on the slopes of
the hills near Tibur; its exact position
is not known. It has been identified
with Monte Affliano, two miles S. E. of
Tivoli. Livy (26. 9) names the ‘arx
Aefulae ¹ as one of the strongholds gar-
risoned on the approach of Hannibal;
and Pliny (3. 9) mentions it as one of
the cities of Latium which had ceased to
exist before his time. There is a doubt
as to the form between Aefula and Aesula.

8. Telegoni iuga3 Epod. 1. 29 ‘ Tus-3
culi Circaea moenia! Legends assigned}
its foundation to Telegonus, the son of
Ulysses by Circe, who unwittingly slew
his father. Arist. Poet. 14.

9. fastidiosam, act. which causes
‘ fastidium,' ‘ which tires.'

10. molem; cp. 2. 15. 1 ‘regiae
moles? Perhaps the ‘domus alta ’
(Epod. 9. 3) of Maecenas on the Esqui-
line. Conington, quoting as parallel
Virg. Aen. 1. 4²1 ‘Miratur molem
Aeneas magalia quondam, Miratur
portas strepitumque et strata viarum)
prefers to take ‘ molem ’ of the buildings
of Rome generally.

11. beatae, ὀλβίαε; cp. 1. 4. 14.
Osten used, as here, for a happiness
vouched for by public opinion, rather
than by the speaker. Cp. Sat. 2. 8. ι
‘ Ut Nasidieni iuvit te coena beati ' ?

12. fumum et opes strepitumque,
