274 HORATII CARMINUM

oDE IV.

‘Lm a young eagle that leaves the nest, tries his wings, then swoops down,
first on sheep-solds, but soon on more dangerous soes 3—1ike ac young lion to the
eyes of the unsuspecting hind, who is to be the first victim of his unfleshed tooth 3-
such has Drusus been in his campaign in Vindelicus—noble by inherited excellence,
noble also by his royal rearing. Rome's gratitude to the house of the Netos is
summed up in the memory of Metaurus, the turning-point of the terrible Punic war,
when Hasdrubal was routed, and the traces of war vanished, and Hannibal himself
bore witness to Rome's vitality. ‘⁴ It is madness for us to pursue our enemy; more
than enough if we can escape their pursuit. From the fires of their native Troy,
from the hardships of the long voyage to Italy, they have but drawn strength and
stubbornness, like the oak on Algidus which the woodman lops, or the hydra ever
growing again to baffle the patience of Hercules. All. hope is gone³for ever, and
bun'ed with Hasdrubal.” And the conqueror was an ancestor of the Neros.
Jupiter protects the race, and Augustus directs their campaigns· What may we not
expect from their arms ? ’

Nero Claudius Drusus, the younger of the two sons os Livia Drusilla, by her ι

first husband, Tiberius Claudius Nero, was born in Augustus· house, mc. 38, three
months after his mother’s divoree and remarriage. He was by far the most popular
of the two brothers. In ao. 16, when Augustus set out for Gaul, taking with him
Tiberius who was praetor at the time, Drusus was appointed to discharge the .
duties of the office during his brother’s absence (Dio 54. 19). Of his eirpedition
in the following year against the Raeti, some account will be found in the Introd„
to this Book. He died, six years afterwards, from the effect of a fall from his

horse, while engaged in the last of three campaigns beyond the Rhine. which -
gained for him the posthumous title of Germanicus. '

apodosis is in v. 17, ⁶ talem ' being sup-
pressed. The purpose of the two similes
is different: the first describes the birth
and training of the young warrior prinoe,
the second the astonishment of the
enemy when they saw him, and knew
instinctively that they were to be the
first -victims of his maiden sword.
