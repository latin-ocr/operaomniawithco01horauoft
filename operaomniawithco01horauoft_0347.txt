LIB. IV. OD. 13.

305

O DE ΧΙΙΙ.

‘ THE gods have heard my prayers, Lyce. I have my revenge. You are turning
into an old woman, yet would fain hide it, and drink and play and love as ever.

Love turns away from your wrinkles; nor will purple gauzes and jewellery bring
back your youth. Where is the beauty that I remember, the charms which made
you second only to Cinara ?—Cinara, who died in her prime, while you live on for

ever, for young men to moralize on and laugh at.'

The Ode is a sequel to 3. 10, in which he complained of Lyce’s high airs‚ and
warned her not to try her 'lover's patience too long.

AUDIVERE, Lyce, di mea vota, di ,
Audivere, Lyce: fis anus, et tamen
Vis formosa videri
Ludisque et bibis impudens
Et cantu tremulo pota Cupidinem 5

Lentum sollicitas.

Ille virentis et

Doctae psallere Chiae
Pulchris excubat'in genis, -
Importunus enim transvolat aridas
Quercus et refugit te, quia luridi 10
Dentes, te quia rugae

Nec Coae referunt iam tibi purpurae
Nee cari lapides tempora, quae semel

2. fis arms . . vis formosa. There
can hardly but be a play on the sound
of the two antithetical words‘ fis‚’ ‘vis.'

8. excubat in genis, ‘keeps vigil on
her beautiful cheeks? Probably a remi—
niscence of Soph. Ant. 782⁹ Epws ἀνίκατε
μάχαν ὅς’ εν μαλακαῖς παρειαΐςνεάνιὸοε’ εννυ-
χευειεε the metaphor there is sustained.

9. importunus, ‘'rudely‚ ‘ruthlessly‚’
very like ⁸ improbus’ in its uses-

amidae quercus, the metaphor 15 sug-
’ gested' ln ‘virentis Chiae’ ; cp. 1.25. 19.
The oak’ is chosen as a long· -lived tree.

10. et, as Dill. points out, has a
consecutive force, and shows the appli-
cation of the metaphor‘ and so’ ; cp. 1.
3. 8, 2. 2. 10.

te . . te. ‘'Te ’ in both cases has to

do double duty, as the object both of
‘refugit ' and of ⁶ turpant.'

12. capitis nives. Quintil. 8. 6. 17,
gives this as an instance of a harsh
metaphor: ‘dura id est a longinqua
similitudine ducta translatio. ' He is
speaking of oratory rather than poetry,
and the metaphor has a special appro-

is sufficiently obvious to be current in
all languages-
