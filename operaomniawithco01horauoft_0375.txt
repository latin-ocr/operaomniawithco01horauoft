‘ LIBER, EPOD. 2.

33'3

Quodsi pudica mulier in partem iuvet
Domum atque dulces liberos, 40
Sabina qualis aut perusta solibus
Pernicis uxor Apuli,
Sacrum vetustis exstruat lignis focum
Lassi sub adventum viri,
Claudensque textis cratibus laetum pecus 45
Distenta siccet ubera,
Et horna dulci vina promens dolio
Dapes inemptas apparet:
Non me Lucrina iuverint conchylia
Magisve rhombus aut scari, 50
Si quos Eois intonata fluctibus
Hiems ad hoc vertat mare3
Non Afra avis descendat in ventrem meum,
Non attagen Ionicus

iuvet, with a zeugma. It is the ap-
propriate verb only with ‘domum‚'
‘graces,’ ‘helps.’ By uniting closely
the two substantives, ‘the home with
its blooming children‚’ we can bring
‘ dulces liberos ’ into some recognisable
. relation to it, but still the new substan-
tive breathes into the verb a new idea
of ‘helping to govern,’ which does not
belong to it properly, and which was
not needed so long as it was only con-
structed with ‘ domum?
