HORATII EPODON

Nobilis ut grandi cecinit Centaurus alumno:
Invicte, mortalis dea nate puer Thetide,
Te manet Assaraci tellus, quam frigida parvi
Findunt Scamandri flumina lubricus et Simo'ss,
Unde tibi reditum certo subtemine Parcae 15
Rupere, nec mater domum caerula te revehet.
Illic omne malum vino cantuque levato,
Deformis aegrimoniae dulcibus alloquiis.

1 2. invicte, to be taken by itself, as
in Virg. Aen. 6. 365 and 8. 293.

13. manet, ⁶ you are fated to go
there.’

Assaraci, the grandfather of Anchises,
Virg. Aen. 1. 284.

frigida, Hom. Il. 22. 151, of one of
the fountains of Scamander (the other
was hot), ἡ δ’ ἑτέρη θέρεϊ προρέει εἰκυῖα
χαλάζῃ ἢ χιόνι ψυχρῇ- ,, , ‚

parvi, not the Homenc vxew, 11. 20.
73 μέγας ποταμὸς βαθυδίνης ὃν Ξάνθον
καλέουσι θεοὶ ἄνδρες δὲ Σκάμανδρον. But
the Romans noticed the smallness of the
streams of Troy, Luc. 9. 974 ⁴ [Caesar]
Inscius in sicco serpentem pulvere rivum
Transierat qui Xanthus erat.² So far as
it has any rhetorical purpose, and the
epithets are sprinkled with a freedom
which Horace's later style would have
repudiated, it seems to carry a faint

verbal antithesis to ‘grande,’ and to
emphasise the ‘ smallness ’ of the lot ‘of

16. mater caerula, Thetis the sea- '

nymph, as ⁶ Circe vitrea: od. 1. 17. το.

18. alloquiis, seems to be used like
the Greek παραμύθια, παρηγορίαι, with a
genitive case, ‘the sweet solaces of grim
sadness.’ Bentley would insert ‘ac' be·

sore ‘ dulcibus’ and construet ‘ aegrimo- ,

niae ' after ‘ malum?
