πο. novo saxo, from its position, contenti tenuissimo cultu viverent in
seems intended as an antithesis to ‘ for· imperio atque in publica dignitate
tuitum caespitem,’ so that ‘novo' must omnia ad gloriam splendoremque re-
be almost equivalent to ‘exquisito,· vocarent!

O DE XVI.

⁴ PnAcE is (at times at least) the prayer of all men, though they do not go the

way to find it. Gold and purple .will not buy it, Grosphus; neither wealth nor ι

rank banish mre; and meantime very little suffices for a happy life if the beart is
free from sear and desire. Moderated desires, not hurrying from place to place,
are the means to avoid care. Go where you will you cannot escape yourself. Care
boards the best appointed trireme and keeps up with the fleetest horseman. Enjoy
the present‘ and don’t think of the future. If troubles come, smile and be patient
and they will be the lighter. Unmixed happiness is not to be looked sor : Achiles
had glory‚ but with it an early death; Tithonus a long life and the weariness of
old age. What you lack 1 may perhaps have, as you have what Ι lack. You

have flocks and herds and purple garments, and I have my little farm, my muse, . -

and a beart to despise my critics.'

⁴ Peace and happiness depend on ourselvae, not on things outside of us? ‘ Quod
petis, hic est, Est Ulubris, animus si te non deficit aequus,’ Epp. 1.- 11. 29. ξ *χ
Grosphus is doubtless the person whom Horace commends to Iccius in Epp. 1.
12. 22-242—
‘Utere Pompeio Grospho, et, si quid petet, ultro
Defer; nil Grosphus nisi verum orabit et aequum.
Vilis amicorum est annona, bonis ubi quid deest-³

We gather from this Ode that he was a man of weakh, and, from both Ode and
Epistle, that his property was in Sicily.
