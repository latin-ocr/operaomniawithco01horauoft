Aemula nec virtus Capuae nec Spartacus acer 5
Novisque rebus infidelis Allobrox,

Nec fera caerulea domuit Germania pube
Parentibusque abominatus Hannibal,

Impia perdemus devoti sanguinis aetas,
F erisque rursus occupabitur solum. 10

Barbarus heu cineres insistet victor et Urbem
Eques sonante verberabit ungula,

Quaeque carent ventis et« solibus ossa Quirini,
Nefas videre! dissipabit insolens.

Forte quid expediat communiter aut melior pars 15
Malis carere quaeritis laboribus:

of Rome lasted so late that Cicero
plays upon it in his two speeches, de
Leg. Agr. contr. Rullum.

Spartacus, cp. Od. 3. 14. 19; the

· Thracian freebooter who, having been

taken and sold as a gladiator, escaped‚
and was for two years (3.0. 73—71) the
tefror of Rome as the leader of the Ser-

vi e war.

6. novis rebus infidelis, ‘the faith-
less ally of revolution’ (‘rebus’ is the
dative), in allusion to the part which
the ambassadors of the Allobroges
played in encouraging and betraying
the Catilinarian conspiracy, Sall. Cat.
41, Cic. in Cat. 3. The Allobroges
stand as the representatives of the
Gauls generally, and the point of the
epithet seems to lie in their faithless-
ness, of which it called to mind a signal
recent instance. Their territory lay be-
tween the Rhone and the Isere.

7. caerulea, ‘blue-eyed‚’ Juv. 13. 164
‘ Caerula quis stupuit Germani lumina,
flavam Caesariem. The reference is to
the incursions of the Cimbri and Teu-
tones, which were finally checked by
Marius and Catulus in the battles of
Aquae Sextiae (ac. 102) and Raudii
Campi (3.0. 101).

8. parentibus abominatus. Orelli
and Dillr. take ‘parentibus’ as ‘our
forefathers,’ but the parallel, Od. 1. 1.
24 ‘ bella matribus detestata,’ seems
conclusive in favour of the simplet
mheaetmir‘iig. (PIIompabrel the common epi-
te,‘ irus anm a.

9. devoti sanguini& the descriptive
genitive, Madv. § 287. The thought is
the same as that of Epod. 7. ‘ There is

a curse on this generation. They draw
their crimes with their blood from their
predecessors.'

10. rursuS, ‘as before the city was
built.’

13. ossa Quirini. Porph. quotes
Varro as saying that there was a tomb
of Romulus ‘post Rostra’ (‘pr0 Ros-
tris‚’ Comm. Cruq.). And Orelli refers
to this a corrupt and obscure fragment
of Festus, ‘niger lapis in Comitio lo-
cum funestum significat ,ut ali (‘?) Romuli
morti destinatum.' Horace ignores the
legend of his apotheosis which he adopts
in Od. 3. 3. 15 foll. ‘Martis equis Ache-
ronta fugit?

14. nefas videre, ‘sight of shame’ 3
Virg. Aen. 8. 688 ‘sequiturque‚ nefas,
Aegyptia 'coniux' ; the infinitive for the
more usual supine ‘mirabile dictu.'
Grammatically, ‘nefas' is an accusative
characterising the action of the ‘dissi-
pabit ossa.‘ ³

15, 16. ‘ May be, with one voice, or,
at least, the better part of you, you are
asking what can help you to get quit of
your sad troubles?

15. melior, explained by v. 37,
⁶ honestior ac dignitatis amantior,’
Orelli.

16. carere, = ‘ ad'carendum.' Bentley,
after Rutgers, objecting to the ambi-
guity of ‘quid expediat carere’? which
might also mean ‘what is the good of
getting quit’? would read ‘quod expe-
diat: taking it as equivalent to ‘quod
bene vortat: ‘quod felix faustum·
que sit.’ The reading has since been
found in the MS. of the tenth century at
St. Gall (σ).
