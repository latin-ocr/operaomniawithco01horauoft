13. comitesque, to be taken with
‘ducere,' so that the adjective covers
‘ tigres ’ as well as ‘ silvas ’ ς see on 1. 2.
1, 1. 5. 6, and for the position of ‘que'
on 1. 30. 6. The reference in the fol-
lowing lines is to the story of Orpheus;

15· immania. It is a question
whether the adjective agrees with
· ianitor,' as Virg. Aen. 6. 400 ⁴ ingens

ianitor,’ or with ‘ aulae.’ Qrelli is prob-
ably· right' in preferring the latter, as
‘aulae' seems* to'want an identifying

epithet. Cp. Sil. ²·551 ‘insomnis lacri- ·

mosae ianitor aulae.’

unemphatic I:rese ,of ‘eius,’ of which
Bentley had previously complained.
This is found in Ovid (Trist. 3. 4. 37)..
and in Horace's Satires (2. 1. 79· 2. 6.
76). In the only other instance of the
word in the odes (4. 8. 18), it is strongly
demonstrative. virgil does not use it
at all. The sion, however, is (as
Jahn points out) quite in Horace's way
(cp. 1. 12. {6-32, 2. 4. 9-12‚ 3.4.61-64.
C. S. 41-44), and the details ofhorror all
make it a stronger instance of the power
of music. The principle of interpola-
tion, early enough to vitiate the MSS.
before the time of the Scholiasts, cannot
be argued on a single case. On the
general question see Mr. Mumo’s re-
marks in the Introduction to Mr. King’s ,
edition, p. xiv. Bentley would remove
part of the difficulty by reading sor
