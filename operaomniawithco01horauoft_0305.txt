LIBER QUARTUS

ODE I-.

‘Amm a summons to arms, Venus! No, spare nie3 it‘ is not with me in my
tenth lustre as it was in the days of poor Cinara. Away, then. to the house of
Paulus Maximus. High-bom, and handsome, and eloquent, and accomplished, he
will bear thy colours more worthily, and, when the victory is won, will pay thee
richer honour. I am too old to love, to drink‚ to play. Yet what am Ι saying?

my heart gives the lie to my words?

INTERMISSA, Venus, diu

1 The language of this Ode answers
to thatlof 3. 26, in which Horace declares
his love-campaigns at an end. In both
places the image is not of Venus attack-
ing the heart of a lover, but of a warfare
carried on with her v'veapons and under
her auspices, in which the poet has once
served, and is now called to serve again.

intermissa„ sc. bella.

3. non sum quasin cp. Epp. 1. 1. 4
⁸ Non eadem est aetas, non mens?

bonae. Perhaps, as Dillr. thinks
(quoting Lucr. 3. 1037 ‘ bonus Ancus’),
the epithet implies that she has been
some time dead.

4. sub regn03 see on Od. 1. 36. 8,
and compare especially 3. 9. 9 ‘ me nunc
Thressa regit Chloe: 2. 8. 18, 19 ‘ servi-
tus‚’ ‘dominae.'

For Cinara see Appendix Ι ‘on the
unknown names in the Odes.'

5. mater saeva Cupidinum. This
line is intentionally repeated from 1. 19.
1. There Venus is invoked at the out-
set of the love-campaign; here, aster it
was or should haye been closed. lt is
the ἄρχετε βωκολικᾶε and the λήγετε
βωκολικᾶε, the altered refrain of the
whole. ‘'Dulcium‚’ ‘ saeva.’ imply that
he is balancing the bitters and sweets
of the old lise.

6. eirca, of time, ‘ hard upon my
fiftieth year? The metaph. of ⁸ flectere '
is of breaking horses. He is too old
and hard-mouthed now for the soft guid-
ance of Venus' rein. Cp. for the expres-
sions Virg. G. 3. 188 ‘det mollibus ora
capistris Invalidus‚’ etc, and ib. 165

8. revocant, ‘call you back,’ as 10
your proper place.
