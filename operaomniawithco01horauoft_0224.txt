182 HORATII CARMINUM

recent alternative suggestions, ‘ villulae’
and ‘ vilicae ' (= ‘ house-keeper ’), both

rest on their resemblance to the latter
part of the MS. reading Apuliae: the

gloss ⁶ casae.’ Mr. Munro refuses
‘villulae’ on the ground of the rarity
of diminutives‚ and this would be a
double diminutive, in Augustan poetry.
